1. **What are the main principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**

- **Explanatory Answer:**  
   Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around the concept of objects, which can contain data and code to manipulate that data. The main principles of OOP are:
  - **Encapsulation:** Bundling the data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class, and restricting access to some of the object's components. This is typically achieved using access modifiers like private, protected, and public. Example:
