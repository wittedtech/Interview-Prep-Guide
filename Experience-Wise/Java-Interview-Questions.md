# Common Interview Questions :

## JAVA :

1. **What is Java?**
   - Java is a platform independent, object-oriented programming language.
   - Use to develop secure scalable and efficient enterprise applications.

- **NOTE :** Java is not fully object oriented programming language as it supports primitive data types such as int, byte, long, shorts, etc; which are not objects.

2. **What are the main features of Java?**

   1. `Simple and Easy to learn :` Because of it's similarity with C++, C## and other programming langugae .
   2. `Platform Independent :` _write once, run anywhere_ concept which means write and compile code into _bytecode, as `.class`_ file and then run that file in any machine which has JVM(Java Virtual Machine) in it.
   3. `Object-Oriented :` Not Pure but Java is fully object-oriented, emphasizing the use of classes and objects.
   4. `Robust and Secure :` Robust because it includes features like automatic garbage collection, exception handling, and strong memory management, reduces the chances of system crashes.
      Secure because it doesn't promote use of explicit pointers as like C and others, also provide secure run time environment, do not promotes and use third party untrusted libraries unlike python and others.
   5. `Multithreading :` supports exceution of multiple thread with in a program, helps in utilizing system resources properly and efficiently and also enhance performce and responsiveness.
   6. `Distributed Computing :` well-suited for distributed computing, because of **Remote Method Invocation(RMI)** and **Application Programming Interface(API)** for socket programming.
   7. `Dynamic and Extensible :` it's the nature of java because of it developers can modify the code during runtime and this nature makes java extensible for scalable and adaptable software.

3. **What is the JVM?**

   - JVM is an abstract machine responsible for compiling and executing java or any other programming language compiled in Java bytecodes.
   - JVM is a kind of interpretor b/w java rogramming language and the underlying hardware.
   - JVM is the part of Java Runtime Environment(JRE).
   - JVM is the reason why java is platform independent.

4. **What are JDK and JRE?**

   - Java Development Kit(JDK) is a complete kit of tools and required jars for java programming and application development.
   - JDK consists Java Runtime Environment(JRE) and also other development tools such as Java Debugger, JavaDoc, compilers, etc.
   - JRE is the part of JDK and they both are platform dependent, i.e. you require different jdk and jre for different systems.
   - JRE doesn't consist any development tools like debugger, compiler instead JRE consists various supporting file and class libraries for JVM to help run the program.
   - JDK = Development Tools + JRE  
     JRE = Libraries for Running the Application (Dependecies JAR, Integration libraries like JDBC(Java Database Connectivity), JNDI(Java Naming and Directory Interface), RMI (Remote Method Invocation) and many more...) + JVM  
     JVM = only the runtime environment to execute the java bytecode.

5. **What are Javaâ€™s access specifiers?**

   - `public :` declaration is visible everywhere.
   - `private :` Declaration are visible only within class.
   - `protected :` declaration are visible within the package and all subclasses.
   - `default :` Declaration is only visible within the package (also known as - package private).

   **NOTE :**

   1. You cannot set the access modifier of getters methods because getter are used to get private variables wherever required.
   2. We cannot declare classes and interfaces private in Java. However, the nested classes can be declared private.
   3. We cannot declare classes or interfaces protected in Java.

6. **What is garbage collection in Java?**

   - Destroying unused objects and cleaning the memory space to ensure smooth execution and preventing abnormal program termination due to OutOfMemmoryErrors, java has a functionality known as garabage collection.
   - Unlike C/C++ where the program is responsible for construction and destruction of object and most of the programmers don't destruct the objects which causes more memory consumption and sometimes no memory lefts for further execution and this lead to abnormal program behaviour.
   - To ignore this issue Garbage Collection comes in handy as of when a program execution starts in JVM , objects gets created in the heap and after sometime when some of the objects are no longer needed garbage collector collects thos objects and free up the heap memory to be utilised during further execution of the program.
   - Types of Activities in Java Garbage Collection  
     Two types of garbage collection activity usually happen in Java. These are:

     **Minor or incremental Garbage Collection:** It is said to have occurred when unreachable objects in the young generation heap memory are removed.  
     **Major or Full Garbage Collection:** It is said to have occurred when the objects that survived the minor garbage collection are copied into the old generation or permanent generation heap memory are removed. When compared to the young generation, garbage collection happens less frequently in the old generation.

   - Garbage Collector (GC) is invoked/called by JVM , Whenever an object becomes eligible for gc and by eleigible mostly i mean an unreachable object, still its not necessary that gc will instatntly collect that object, it will be destroyed whenever JVM will call the gc but if we want to call garbage collector manually we can do so with two different methods and they both are equally capable :

   1. `System.gc()` method : System clas contain static method gc() to manually call garbage collector.
   2. `Runtime.getRuntime.gc()` method : Runtime class allows us to interface the JVM in which the application is running and but using its gc() method we can request JVM to call garbage collector.  
      **NOTE :** - Both the methods are equally effective and by using these two methods it not guaranteed that garbage collector will run for sure.

   - **Grabage Collector** internally callls `finalize()` method present in Object class just before destroying any objects from the heap finalize() method is called on that object to perform a final cleanup process and after that garbage collector destroys that object. `finalize()` runs only once per object.  
     **NOTE :**

     1. finalize() method is called by Garbage Collector not by JVM.
     2. ```java
            // empty implementation.
           protected void finalize() throws Throwable

           // it is recommmended to override finalize() method to dispose system resources and perform other cleanup properly.
        ```

     3. If an uncaught exception is thrown by the finalize() method, the exception is ignored, and the finalization of that object terminates.

7. **What is the finalize() method?**

   - `finalize() :` this method is present in Object class and has an empty implementation. finalize() is called by Garbage Collector on the object which is going to be collected to perform necessary cleanup process before garabge collector collects and destroy that object . Clean up process such as closing connection, removing eventlisteners, releasing resources.
   - Recommended to override `finalize()` method to write our custom cleanup and call super.finalize() inside override method to call the Object class finalize to finally complete the cleanup process.

8. **What are the types of memory areas allocated by JVM?**

   - The memory in the JVM is divided in to 5 different parts:

     1. `Class(Method) Area` : This area is the memory block that holds all the class code, variable code(static variable, runtime constant), method code, and the constructor of java program. Store class level data of every class.
     2. `Heap` : This memory block is the place where objects are created and stored. heam memory allocated memory for class interfaces and array(arrays are objets). It is used to allocate memory to objcts at run time.

     ```
     NOTE : Static Methods and Variables were previous stored in Class Area (Till Java 8). But, in current versions of Java static variables and methods are stored in Heap Memory.
     ```

     3. `Stack` : Stack is responsible for holding execution data and result which are required for dynamic linking. Let's understand it clearly : Every thread has its own private JVM stack, created at same time as the thread. It is used to store data and partial results which will be required when returning value for methods and performing dynamic linking.
        Java Stack Stores frames and frames are created for mthod every time method is invoked and destroyed when invocation completes.
     4. `Program Counter Register` : Program Counter(PC) Register is associated with every thread and stores information/data of the their own thread. Stores the address of the current instruction being executed by the thread.
        - In Case of Non-native methods(Method written in JAVA) : Stores the address of the current bytecode instruction being executed.
        - In Case of Native Methods(Method written in another language like C/C++) : PC Register has undefined value.
     5. `Native Method Stack` : This is also a per-thread data area but unlike JVM stack it is designed to support execution of native methods because natice methods are not compiled in java bytecode so PC Register value becomes undefined i.e. we need Native Metod Stack.

9. **What is the difference between an interface and an abstract class?**

   - `Interface :` Interface only contains abstract methods, Interface supports multiple inheritence(i.e. a clas can implement multiple interfaces). Inteefaces can not be instantiated. Interface supports absolute abstraction. Interfaces are implicitly abstract. Interfaces can have only abstract methods. Interface can only extend another Java Interface. By default Variable are final and methods are public inside interfaces. Interfaces are implemented by using keyword `implements`.
   - `Abstract Class` : Abstract class doesn't support absolute abstraction. Can extend another java clasd and implements multiple interfaces. Abstract Classes also can not be instantiated but can be invoked if main() exists. Abstract classes are not implicitly abstract we need to define abstract class by using `abstract` keyword before class name. Abstract classes variable may be non-final as well and methods can have access specifier same as normal classes. Abstract classes can be used by extending them using `extends` keyword.

10. **How do ArrayList, LinkedList, HashMap, HashSet, TreeMap, and TreeSet differ?**

    - `ArrayList` and `LinkedList` both are the implementation of list interface.
      1. **ArrayList** is better for random access of elements as it follow indexing based access.
      2. **LinkedList** is better for insertion and deletion process as it carries pointer/address/refrence of elements and only updates the pointer for the new location no resizing of data structure is done in the background as like array.
    - `HashMap`, `HashSet` `TreeMap` and `TreeSet` these are the implementation of Map and Set interfaces.

      1. **HashMap** and **HashSet** are better for quick access and insertion operation because of hashing technique.
      2. **TreeMap** and **TreeSet** are better for sorting and maintning order because their respective sorting techniques.

    - When to Use Each
      1. Use **ArrayList** when elements are accessed by index and the size of the collection is known in advance.
      2. Use **LinkedList** when elements are frequently inserted or deleted at specific positions.
      3. Use **HashMap** when elements are accessed by key and quick access time is important.
      4. Use **HashSet** when elements are unique and quick access time is important.
      5. Use **TreeMap** when elements need to be sorted and quick access time is important.
      6. Use **TreeSet** when elements need to be sorted and quick access time is important.

11. **How does the HashMap work internally?**

    - Hashmap is a data structure in java which stores data in the form of key-value pairs and provides faster access and retrieval of values.
    - It uses the technique of **Hash Function** to calculate the **hash** of the key and according to that hash it decides in which index the key-value pair will be stored in the array.
    - Array used in HashMap to store key-value pair is known as **bucket-array**. Each index in the array is a bucket and every bucket can hold multiple key-value pairs.
    - In case when two or more keys has the same Hash and they gets assigned to the same index to be stored this is k/a **Collision** and to solve collision HashMap has the technique named as **Chaining**.
    - In **Chaining**, each bucket in the array is a linkedlist of key-value pairs whose hash are same . This allows hashmap to store multiple key-value pair in the same array index.
    - `PUT` and `GET` operation in hashmap are the two major operations
      1. **put(key,value)** this method is used to store the key value in HashMap. this operation first calculates the Hash code for the key using Hash Function and use the hash code to determine the index and if teh index is already occupied then it handles the coliision by adding new key-value pair in the linkedlist at that index.
      2. **get(key)** this method is used to get the value associated with the key, same as put it also calculates the Hash of the key and identify the index to check for the value and if the index hash multiple key-values stored then it check the complete linkedlist of that index and uses `equals()` method to fetch the exact key.
    - HashMap are not thread safe by default but can be made thread safe using `synchronized` block or a lock.

- **SUMMARY :**
  HashMap in java use itâ€™s inner class Node<K,V> for storing mappings. HashMap works on hashing algorithm and uses hashCode() and equals() method on key for get and put operations. HashMap use singly linked list to store elements, these are called bins or buckets. When we call put method, hashCode of key is used to determine the bucket that will be used to store the mapping. Once bucket is identified, hashCode is used to check if there is already a key with same hashCode or not. If there is an existing key with same hashCode, then equals() method is used on key. If equals returns true, then value is overwritten, otherwise a new mapping is made to this singly linked list bucket. If there is no key with same hashCode then mapping is inserted into the bucket. For HashMap get operation, again key hashCode is used to determine the bucket to look for the value. After bucket is identified, entries are traversed to find out the Entry using hashCode and equals method. If match is found, value is returned otherwise null is returned. There are much more things involved such as hashing algorithm to get the bucket for the key, rehashing of mappings etc. But for our working, just remember that HashMap operations work on Key and good implementation of hashCode and equals method is required to avoid unwanted behaviour. Below image shows the explanation of get and put operations.

12. **What are the differences between fail-fast and fail-safe iterators?**

- **Fail-Fast** iterators are those who iterates over the main collection instead of a copy collection. They consumes less memory space because they do not need to create a copy of collection. In these iterators if you modify the main collection (i.e. add, remove, or sort elements) it will throw an `ConcurrentModificationException` and abort the operation as soon as they get this exception.
  **Example :** ArrayList, List, Map etc. (Collection provided by `java.util.Collection.*` package are all Fail-Fast).
- **Fail-Safe** iterators ar e those who iterates over the clone/copy of the collection instead of main collection. They consumes more memory space as they have to create a copy of collection. These type of iterators try to avoid any kind of failure and they do not throw any exception even if the main collection is modified.
  **Example :** copyOnWriteArrayList, copyOnWriteArraySet (Collections provides by `java.util.Concurrent.*` packages are all Fail-Safe).
- **NOTE :**
  1. If we remove/add the element using the remove() or add() of iterator instead of collection, then in that case no exception will opccur. It is because the remove/add methods of iterators call the remove/add method of collection internally, and also it reasigns the expectedModCount to new modCount value.
  2. There is no such thing as Fail-Safe iterator in java documentation instead of this it is k/a `Non-Fail-Fast` iterators.
  3. **Fail-Safe** will not reflect the latest state of the collection.

13. **What is multithreading in Java?**

- Multithreading in java is an act of executing a processes using virtual processing entities independent of each other. These entities are k/a `Threads.` Running multiple threads concurrently is `multithreading.`

14. **What are the different ways to create a thread in Java?**

- There are two ways to create a thread in java :
  1. `By extending Thread class :` First create a class that extends Thread and overrides the run() method. Now thread can be created by creating the object of our newly created class and calling the run() method.
  2. `By implenting Runnable interface :` Thread class must implement the runnable interface and the thread class must override the run() method.

15. **What is synchronization in Java?**

- Synchronization in java is the capability to control access of multiple threads over a shared resources. Synchronization allows only one thread at a particular time to complete a given task entirely. Synchronization saves the systems to approach race condition.
- In simple words, Synchronization is a way to ensure that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time.
- We can achieve thread synchronization in java by using `synchronized` keyword and :

  1. `By Using Synchronized Method :` an method is synchronized using synchronized keyword.
     ```java
     public class Counter {
        private static int count = 0;
        public static synchronized void increment() {
            count++;
        }
        public static int getCount() {
           return count;
        }
     }
     ```
  2. `By Using Synchronized Block :` an code block synchronized inside a method.
     ```java
     class Table{
        void printTable(int n){
           synchronized(this){//synchronized block
              for(int i=1;i<=5;i++){
                 System.out.println(n*i);
                 try{
                 Thread.sleep(400);
                 }catch(Exception e){System.out.println(e);}
              }
           }
        }//end of the method
     }
     ```
  3. `By Using Static Synchronization :`

     ```java
     public class GirlFriend {
        public static synchronized void sing() {
           try {
                 for (int i = 1; i <= 10; ++i) {
                    System.out.println("lullaby");
                    Thread.sleep(100);
                 }
           } catch (Exception e) {
           }
        }
        }

        public static synchronized void count() {
           try {
                 for (int i = 1; i <= 10; ++i) {
                    System.out.println(i);
                    Thread.sleep(100);
                 }
           } catch (Exception e) {
           }
        }
     }
     ```

- _In summary, static synchronization is used to synchronize access to static methods, which are methods that belong to a class rather than an instance of the class. It ensures that only one thread can execute a static synchronized method at a time, regardless of the objects involved. This is different from synchronized methods or synchronized blocks, which lock on the instance of the class or a specific object, respectively._

16. **What is a deadlock in Java?**

- Deadlock is a situation when two or more computer programs/threads are sharing the same resources and wait for each other to release the lock from the resource and due to this the programs/threads block each other and this situation or blockage of threads for indefinite time period is k/a Deadlock.

17. **What are thread-safe collections in Java?**

- Collections those are designed to use by multiple threads without using external synchronization are thread-safe collections.
- List of all the by default thread-safe collections :
  1. `ConcurrentHashMap:` This is a thread-safe version of the HashMap class. It uses a lock striping mechanism to improve performance and scalability.
  2. `CopyOnWriteArrayList:` This is a thread-safe version of the ArrayList class. It creates a new array for each modification, ensuring that iterators do not throw ConcurrentModificationException.
  3. `CopyOnWriteArraySet:` This is a thread-safe version of the HashSet class. It uses the same copy-on-write mechanism as CopyOnWriteArrayList to ensure thread safety.
  4. `ConcurrentLinkedQueue:` This is a thread-safe version of the Queue interface. It uses a compare-and-swap mechanism to ensure that operations are atomic and do not throw ConcurrentModificationException.
  5. `ConcurrentSkipListMap:` This is a thread-safe version of the Map interface. It uses a compare-and-swap mechanism to ensure that operations are atomic and do not throw ConcurrentModificationException.
  6. `ConcurrentSkipListSet:` This is a thread-safe version of the Set interface. It uses a compare-and-swap mechanism to ensure that operations are atomic and do not throw ConcurrentModificationException.
  7. `Vector:` This is a legacy thread-safe collection that is synchronized at the object level. It is less efficient than other thread-safe collections due to the overhead of synchronization.
  8. `Hashtable:` This is another legacy thread-safe collection that is synchronized at the object level. It is less efficient than other thread-safe collections due to the overhead of synchronization.

18. **What are threads, and how are they different from processes?**

- Process is execution of a program with its own memory space and address and managed by operating system.
- Thread is the part of process every process has at least one thread present and that thread share the same memory of the process. Threads are lightweight processes(i.e. Process divided in multiple sub process/thread) and threads can be ,managed indivisually by the scheduler.
- Creating a new thread requires fewer resources than creating a process.

19. **Explain synchronized, volatile, wait(), notify(), and notifyAll().**

- `synchronized :`
  - **Purpose :** Ensures only one thread executes the block of code at a time.
  - **Usage :** used with `synchronized` keyword to lock an object and ensure thread safety.
  - **Example :**
    ```java
    public class Girlfriend{
       public synchronized void sing(){
          // code to be executed
       }
    }
    ```
- `volatile :`
  - **Purpose :** Ensures that changes to a variable are immediately visible to all threads.
  - **Usage :** used with `volatile` keyword to declare a variable that should be updated immediately.
  - **Example :**
    ```java
    public class Employee{
       public volatile int count = 0;
       public void incrementCount(){
          count++;
       }
    }
    ```
- `wait() :`
  - **Purpose :** Cause a thread to wait until another thread notifies it.
  - **Usage :** used to pause a thread until specific condition is met.
  - **Example :**
    ```java
    public class PrintDemo{
       private final Object lock = new Object();
       public void printCount(){
          // defining a synchronized block
          synchronized(lock){
             for(int i=0; i<5; i++>){
                System.out.println("Counter :"+i);
                try{
                   lock.wait(); // invoked the wait method to make lock thread wait until another thread notifies.
                }catch(InterruptedException e){
                   System.out.println("Thread Interrupted.");
                }
             }
          }
       }
    }
    ```
- `notify() :`
  - **Purpose :** Wakes up a thread that is waiting on a specific object.
  - **Usage :** Used to notify a thread that is waiting on a specific object.
  - **Example :**
    ```java
    public class PrintDemo{
       private final Object lock = new Object();
       public void printCount(){
          // defining a synchronized block
          synchronized(lock){
             for(int i=0; i<5; i++>){
                System.out.println("Counter :"+i);
                try{
                   lock.notify(); // invoked the notify method to make waiting thread continue its task.
                }catch(InterruptedException e){
                   System.out.println("Thread Interrupted.");
                }
             }
          }
       }
    }
    ```
- `notifyAll() :`
  - **Purpose :** Wakes up all the threads that are waiting on a specific object.
  - **Usage :** Used to notify all the threads waiting on a specific object.
  - **Example :**
    ```java
    public class PrintDemo{
       private final Object lock = new Object();
       public void printCount(){
          // defining a synchronized block
          synchronized(lock){
             for(int i=0; i<5; i++>){
                System.out.println("Counter :"+i);
                try{
                   lock.notifyAll(); // invoked the notifyAll method to make all the lock threads continue their task.
                }catch(InterruptedException e){
                   System.out.println("Thread Interrupted.");
                }
             }
          }
       }
    }
    ```
- _These concepts are important for ensuring thread safety and synchronization in java._

20. **What are thread pools, and how do you create them using the ExecutorService?**

- A thread pool is a collection of thread that can be used to perform a set of task concurrently. For this we have an Executor Framework provided by java in the `java.util.concurrent.*` package ; inside this package their is an `ExecutorService` interface that defines a set of methods fo rmanaging the lifecycle of threads in a thread pool.
- By using ExecutorService, we can create, execute, and manage threads without having to manage their lifecycle manually. `java.util.concurrent.` package provides us two main Classes to manage thread pool `ExecutorService` and `Executors`.
- `Executors` class provides lots of factory methods that can create different types of Executors. Some of the most commonly used Executors are :

  1. `newSingleThreadExecutor() :` The newSingleThreadExecutor() method creates an Executor that uses a single worker thread to execute tasks. This type of Executor is useful when we want to ensure that tasks are executed in the order in which they are submitted.

  ```java
     ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
     executor.submit(() -> {
        System.out.println("Task 1");
     });
     executor.submit(() -> {
        System.out.println("Task 2");
     });
     executor.shutdown();
  ```

  ```html
  Task 1 Task 2
  ```

  2. `newFixedThreadPoolExecutor() :` The newFixedThreadPool() method creates an Executor that uses a fixed number of worker threads to execute tasks. This type of Executor is useful when we want to limit the number of threads that are used to execute tasks.

  ```java
  ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
     executor.submit(() -> {
        System.out.println("Task " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
     });
  }
  executor.shutdown();
  ```

  ```html
  Task pool-1-thread-2 Task pool-1-thread-3 Task pool-1-thread-1 Task
  pool-1-thread-3 Task pool-1-thread-1
  ```

  - When you submit a task to a fixed-size thread pool, and all threads are busy executing other tasks, the task is added to the queue of pending tasks. The pending tasks will wait in the queue until a thread becomes available to execute them.
  - If the queue becomes full and there are no available threads to execute tasks, the Executor will reject the task submission with a RejectedExecutionException. The rejection policy can be configured to throw an exception, block the calling thread, or discard the task, depending on the implementation of the Executor.

  3. `newCachedThreadPool() :` This type of thread pool is suitable for executing short-lived asynchronous tasks that do not have a fixed rate of arrival. It is also useful when the number of threads needed to handle the workload is not known in advance, as the thread pool will dynamically adjust the number of threads to handle the workload.

  ```java
  ExecutorService executor = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
     executor.submit(() -> {
        System.out.println("Task " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
     });
  }
  executor.shutdown();

  ```

  - The CachedThreadPoolExecutor uses a keep-alive time to determine when to remove idle threads. If a thread is idle for the specified keep-alive time, it is removed from the thread pool.

  4. `newScheduledThreadPool() :` This executor is used to schedule a task to run after a certain delay, or to run repeatedly at a fixed interval. This is useful for tasks that need to be run periodically or on a schedule.

  ```java
  ScheduledExecutorService executor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(2);
  // Schedule a task to run after 3 seconds
  executor.schedule(() -> System.out.println("Task executed after 3 seconds"), 3, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
  // Schedule a task to run repeatedly every 1 second
  executor.scheduleAtFixedRate(() -> System.out.println("Task executed every 1 second"), 0, 1, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
  ```

  ```html
  Task executed every 1 second Task executed every 1 second Task executed every
  1 second Task executed after 3 seconds Task executed every 1 second Task
  executed every 1 second Task executed every 1 second Task executed every 1
  second Task executed every 1 second Task executed every 1 second Task executed
  every 1 second Task executed every 1 second Task executed every 1 second Task
  executed every 1 second Task executed every 1 second . . .
  ```

- **newSingleThreadExecutor()** vs **newFixedThreadPool(1)**
  Main difference between the two is the type of queue used. `newSingleThreadExecutor()` uses an unbounded queue, while `Executors.newFixedThreadPool(1)` uses a fixed-size queue. If the application submits many tasks to the thread pool, the unbounded queue of `newSingleThreadExecutor()` can lead to out-of-memory errors, while the fixed-size queue of `Executors.newFixedThreadPool(1)` prevents the number of queued tasks from exceeding a certain limit.
- **Future**
  In cases where you donâ€™t want to wait for the result to be available, you can use the `submit()` method of the `Executor` interface to submit the `Callable` and obtain a `Future` object that represents the result of the computation.

  You can then use this `Future` object to check if the computation is complete or not using the `isDone()` method. If the computation is not complete, you can perform other tasks, and later retrieve the result of the computation using the `get()` method of the `Future` object.

  If you donâ€™t want to wait for the result, you can simply discard the `Future` object without calling the `get()` method.

  ```java
  import java.util.concurrent.*;
  public class FutureExample {
     public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);
        Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(new Callable<Integer>() {
              public Integer call() throws Exception {
                 Thread.sleep(5000);
                 return 42;
              }
        });
        System.out.println("Other tasks running...");
        int result = future.get();
        System.out.println("Computation result: " + result);
        executor.shutdown();
     }
  }
  ```

- **Cancelling a submitted Task**
  The `Future` interface returned by the `submit()` method has a `cancel()` method that can be used to cancel a task.

  ```java
  ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();

  Future<Integer> futureTask = executor.submit(() -> {
     // Simulate a long-running task
     Thread.sleep(5000);
     return 42;
  });

  // Try to cancel the task after 2 seconds
  boolean cancelled = futureTask.cancel(true);
  if (cancelled) {
     System.out.println("Task cancelled successfully.");
  } else {
     System.out.println("Task could not be cancelled.");
  }

  executor.shutdown();
  ```

  ```html
  Task cancelled successfully.
  ```

  The `cancel()` method takes a _boolean_ argument that specifies whether the task should be interrupted _if it has already started running_. If the task has _not started running_, it will simply be _removed from the Executor's task queue_.

21. **What are checked and unchecked exceptions?**

- **Checked Exceptions :**

  1. Checked exceptions are exceptions that must be either handled or declared in a method's `throws` clause.
  2. Checked Execptions are handled using `try-catch` block or by declaring them in a method's throws clause.
  3. Chceked Exceptions are caught at compile time.
  4. **Example :** IOException, FileNotFoundException, SQLException etc.

- **Unchecked Exceptions :**
  1. Unchecked Exceptions are exceptions that are not checked by compiler and do not need to declared in method's throws clause.
  2. Unchecked Exceptions are also handled using `try-catch` block but they do not need to be declared in a method's throws clause.
  3. Unchecked Exception are caught by JVM at Runtime.
  4. **Example :** ArithmeticException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, NullPointerException etc.

```java
// Checked Exception Example
public class CheckedException {
   public void readFile() throws FileNotFoundException {
      String fileName = "file does not exist";
      File file = new File(fileName);
      FileInputStream stream = new FileInputStream(file);
   }
}

// Unchecked Exception Example
public class UncheckedException {
   public void divide() {
      int x = 0;
      int y = 10;
      int z = y / x;
   }
}
```

**Note :** Checked exceptions are typically used to handle logical errors in the program, while unchecked exceptions are used to handle runtime errors that are often caused by programming errors.

22. **How does the try-catch-finally block work?**

- **try block :** The `try` block contains the code that may thorw and exception and if an exception occurs the rest of the try block is skipped and the control transfers to the attched `catch` block. In case no Execption is thrown `catch` block is skipped and the if there is any `finally` block attached the control will be transfered to that block.
- **catch() block :** The `catch` block is used to handle the exception that might be thrown in the `try` block. cathc block takes the name of Exception it can handle as the parmeter and then if an exception occurs and matched the exceptions present in catch block parameter then the catch block is executed. In case the Exception can not be handled by the catch block, the default exception handling mechanism is invoked, and the program terminates abnormally.
- **finally block :** The `finally` block is used to execute important code, such as closing connections or resources, no matter if the exception occurs or not. The finally block is always executed, whether an execption is handled or not; unless the program exits abruptly(e.g. by calling `System.exit()` or due to a fatal error). If an exception occur in `try` block and is handled by `catch` block then the `finally` block gets executed after the catch block.

```java
try {
 // code that might throw an exception
 int result = 10 / 0;
   System.out.println("Inside try block");
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
   System.out.println("Exception caught in catch block");
} finally {
   System.out.println("finally block executed");
}
System.out.println("Outside try-catch-finally clause");
```

23. **What is the difference between throw and throws?**

- The `throw` keyword is used inside a method; and `throws` keyword is used in the method signature.
- The `throw` keyword throws an exception explicitly but the `throws` keyword decalres that the method might throw an exception.
- `throw` keyword throws and instance of Exception class but `throws` define that the method will throw which of the exception class.
- **Example :**
  1. **throw :**
     ```java
     try {
     // code that might throw an exception
     int result = 10 / 0;
     throw new ArithmeticException();
     } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
        System.out.println("Exception caught in catch block");
     }
     ```
  2. **throws :**
     ```java
     public void withdraw(double amount) throws InsufficientBalanceException {
        if (balance < withdrawAmount) {
           throw new InsufficientBalanceException("You have insufficient balance");
        }
     }
     ```

24. **Explain the Java memory model.**

- Java Memory Model(JMM) supervise/control **how threads in java interact with memory**. It ensures that **changes made by one thread visible to all others, providing a framework for safe multi-threading**. It also ensures proper synchronization using constructs(a block of code that initializes) like `synchronized` **blocks**, `volatile`. **and memory barriers.**
- JMM is responsible for preventing data races(i.e. threads accessing shared resource without suffiecient protection, leading to abnormal behaviour.) and ensures consistent behavior in multi-threaded Java program.

- JMM has two main parts :

  1. **THREAD STACK**

     - Each thread running has it's own stack and is k/a thread stack.
     - used to store Local varibales for primitive(int,long,double, etc.) types.
     - These thread stacks are not visible to other threads even if they are running the same piece of code.
     - they will create their own seperate copies of local variables for that code in their own thread stack.  
      
      **Creation of Thread Stack :**

     1. When thread is started, JRE creates a new empty thread stack for that thread.
     2. When thread calls any `methodA()`, JRE pushes a new Frame(Stack Frame- Data Structure used to store state of the method being executred.) onto thread stack. This frame stores the call stack and local variables for the methodA().
     3. When `method A()` call any other `method B()`,, JRE pushes another frame onto the thread stack to store the call stack and local varibales for the methodB().
     4. When methodB() returns, JRE pops the frame for methodB() off the thread stack. When methodA() returns, JRE pops the frame of it off the thread stack.

     **KEY FEATURES:**

     1. **Dynamic Growth and Shrinkage :** Stack Memory grows and shrinks as new method are called and returned respectively as their new stack frame is created and removed respectively.
     2. **Limited Lifetime :** Varibales declared in the stack exists as long as the method that created them is running, once finish complete frame and local variable are deallocated.
     3. **Automatic Allocation and Deallocation:** Stack memory is automatically allocated when method is called and deallocated when method finishes executing.
     4. **StackOverflowError :** if the stack becomes full due to excessive method calls(e.g. recursion without any base case), java throws `StackOverflowError`.
     5. **FAST ACCESS :** Stack memory offers fast access compared to Heap Memory because of its working mechanism i.e. Last-In First-Out(LIFO).
     6. **Thread Safety :** Each thread's, Method and local variables are isolated with each other because they operates in their own stack.

  2. **HEAP MEMORY**

     - Heap is a separate meory area that contains all the objects created in a Java application, regardless of which thread created them.
     - This includes objects of primitive types(e.g. Integer, Long).
     - Every object created is stored in heap, no matter if an object was created and assigned to a local variable or created as a member varible of another object.

       **Key Features :**

       1. **OutOfMemoryError :**
          - When heap space is full and become insufficient to allocate new objects, java throws and _OutOfMemoryError._
          - Giving a real life example : loading a large dataset into memory or when there's a memory leak.
          ```java
          public class OutOfMemoryExample {
             public static void main(String[] args) {
                try {
                      // Attempt to create a very large array to fill up heap space
                      int[] bigArray = new int[Integer.MAX_VALUE];
                } catch (OutOfMemoryError e) {
                      System.err.println("OutOfMemoryError: " + e.getMessage());
                }
             }
          }
          ```
       2. **Heap Memory Access is Slower Than Stack Memory :**

          - Heap Memory is slower because it involves dynamic memory allocation and deallocation manages by the Garbage Collector(GC).
          - Stack Memory acces is faster because it simply involves pushing and popping elements from the stack.

       3. **Heap Memory is not thread-safe :**
          - Heap memory is not inherently thread-safe, meaning that when multiple threads access and modify shared objects in the heap concurrently, it can lead to data races and inconsistent states.
          - Proper synchronization mechanisms like synchronized blocks, locks, or using thread-safe data structures from the java.util.concurrent package should be used to make heap-based data structures thread-safe.
       4. Object and their Member Variables, Static class Variables all are stores on the heap and can be accessed by all other threads.

25. **What is garbage collection, and how does it work?**

- Garbage Collection is a memory recovery feature built into programming language such as C# and Java. A GC enables programming language includes one or more garbage collectors (GC engines) that automatically free up memory space taht has been alloocated to objects no longer needed by the program. Garbage Collector are used to allocated space in the Heap memory dynamically. Garbage collectors helps prevent meory leak and ensure memory used by program remain efficient and organized.
- **Working Of Garabage Collection :**
  1. **Reference Counting :** Each object is created in the program is assigned a reference(where the object is connected) count. whenever any refrence gets connected with the object reference count is increased by one and when reference is removed or goes out of scope the count is decreased by one. if the count reaches Zero, then the object is considered garbage, eligible for garbage collection and can be freed.
  2. **Mark-and-Sweep Algorithm :** This algorithm works in two major phases-
     **Marking :** The GC traverse through the graph of objects and mark each objects if they are reachable by the roots(thread, static fields, local variables, and CPU registers).
     **Sweeping :** After marking each and every object, GC sweeps all the objects that are not marked reachable in the marking phase.
  3. **Generational Garbage Collection :** Heap memory have two types of generational space, `Young Generation` to store newly created young objects and `Old(Tenured) Generation` to store objects surpassed their maximum survival cycle according to `-XX:MaxTenuring Threshold` and are considered as old objects.
     `Young Generation` consists different spaces for objects; `Eden Space` to store fresh newly created objects, `Survivor 1` and `Survivor 2` to store objects survived when Eden Space gets full and `Minor GC` kicks in and collects the dead objects(objects unreachable) and move live objects(objects still reachable) in the survivor space and increase their survivor count by 1 and free up the Eden space to again store the newly created objects, again when it get full minor GC kicks in and collects all the dead objects from Eden Space and Survivor Space and Move the live objects from eden space and previously left objects in survivor space to another survivor space and increase their survivor count by 1 again and this process continues, when any objects reaches its `MaxTenuring Threshold` i.e. 6 and minor GC kicks in it complete its regular process and move objects to Old generation whose survivor count is equal to 6.
     - Why this process of moving Old Generation important is to avoid `Full GC` because its an evil situation and because of Generational Collection we try to avoid this situation upto certain extent. Whenever Old Generation space gets full it requires full GC and full GC requires to stop the application further its process gets completed i.e. why minor GC running is more frequent than Full GC.
  4. **Memory Compaction :** Memories are divided in fragments to and fragments gets utilised to store the object or resources in random fragments because of the fragmentation sometime even when there is free space we are not able to utilise it properly to avoid this situation we have a technique named as `Compaction ` i.e. the process of bringing all the occupied fragments together and leaving empty fragments together.
     After the Garbage Collection, Garbage Collectore compacts the memory by moving all the reachable objects to a contiguous block, freeing up memory space and reducing fragmentation.
  5. **Object Identification :** Objects are identified as garbage when their refernce count becomes 0 and this happens when the object is no longer needed, becomes unreachable, or goes outof scope.
  6. **Object Reclamation :** The garbage collector reclaims the memory space by occupied by the garbage objects by cleaning up the garbage objects and allocate the space for future object creation. This process ensures that the memory used by the program remains efficient and organized.

26. **What are strong, weak, soft, and phantom references?**

- **Strong References :** These are the defualt references used to prevent garabage collection to clean the object from the memory. All other references allows the object to be garbage collected in different scenerios. `String str = "abc"` creates string reference to the String object.
- **Weak References :** These references do not prevent the object from being collected by the Garbage Collector as soon as the object becomes weakly reachable (only accessible by the weak references), it can be removed by the garabage collector from the memory. These refernces are commonly used for caching and canonicalizing mapping.
- **Soft References :** These references are similar to weak references but they are cleared less aggressively by the garabage collector. Objects with soft references are only clear when the JVM is running low on memory. Soft references are useful for implementing memory-sensitive cahces.
- **Phantom References :** These are the weakest type of references and they do not prevent the object from being collected by the GC and also they do provide a way to access the object. Phantom references are enqueued with a ReferenceQueue after an object has been collected. they are useful for scheduling post-mortem cleanup actions and detecting when an object has been garbage collected.

27. **Explain lambda expressions and functional interfaces in Java 8.**

- **Lambda Expression :** Lambda expression are the annonymous functions use to implement functional interfaces(interfaces with a single abstract method). Lambda expressions are used to reduce boilerplate code and make the code more concise and readable.
  Lambda Expressions mainly consists of three parts :
  - **Parameter List :** list of parameters that the lambda expressions accepts and are enclosed with parantheses '()'.
  - **Arrow Operator :** An arrow operator ' -> ' to separate parameter list from the lambda body.
  - **Lambda Body :** Lambda body is the code that is executed when the lambda expression is invoked. It Can be a single statement or a block of statements.

```java
int square = (int x) -> x*x ;
```

- **Functional Interfaces :** Functional interfaces only have a single abstract method. This means the interface implementation will only represent one behaviour. `Runnable` , `Callable` , `Comparator` , and `Function` are the example of functional interfaces.

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface SquareRoot {
   double findSquareRoot(int n);
}
```

28. **What are streams in Java 8, and how do you use them?**

- Stream is the concept introduced in java 8, provides a way to process collections of objects in a functional style and is a part of Java collection framework. They allow to process sequences of elements in a functional style, providing a powerful and efficient way to perform operations on collection of data.
- **Key Characteristics of Streams:**
  1. **Sequence of Elements:** Stream represents sequences of elements from a source(data whose stream is created) such as collection, an array, or an I/O channel.
  2. **Functional in Nature:** Stream supports Functional-style operations, making extensive use of lambda expressions.
  3. **Pipelined Processing:** Stream operations can be chained together to form a pipeline. Intermediate operations are lazy and are not executed until a terminal operation is invoked.
  4. **Parallelizable:** Streams can be processed in parallel without having to explicitly manage thread creation and synchronization.
- **Types of Stream Operations:**
  1. **Intermediate Operations:** These operations transform a stream into another stream and are lazy, meaning they are not executed until a terminal operation is called. Example include `map()`, `filter()`, `distinct()`, `sorted()`, and `limit()`.
  2. **Terminal Opertaions:** These operations produce a result or side-effect and are executed once on the entire stream pipeline. Example include `forEach()`, `collect()`, `reduce()`, `count()`, and `anyMatch()`.
- ```java
   import java.util.Arrays;
   import java.util.List;
   import java.util.stream.Collectors;

   public class StreamExample {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
         List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Eve");

         // Using stream to filter, map, and collect
         List<String> filteredNames = names.stream()
                                             .filter(name -> name.length() > 3)
                                             .map(String::toUpperCase)
                                             .sorted()
                                             .collect(Collectors.toList());

         // Printing the result
         filteredNames.forEach(System.out::println);
      }
   }
   // In this example, we filter the names with length greater than 3, convert them to uppercase, sort them, and then collect the result into a list which is printed out.
  ```

29. **How do Optional and the new date/time API work in Java 8?**

- **Optional Class:**
  Optional class is a container object used to contain non-null values. it is primarily intended to represent the absence and presence of a value and to avoid `NullPointerException`.

  - **Key Methods Of Optional:**

    1. **Creating an Optional:**
       - `Optional.of(value)`: Creates an Optional with a non-null value.
       - `Optional.ofNullable(value)`: Creates an Optional that may contain a null value.
       - `Optional.empty()`: Creates an empty Optional.
       - ```java
          Optional<String> nonEmptyOptional = Optional.of("Hello");
          Optional<String> nullableOptional = Optional.ofNullable(null);
          Optional<String> emptyOptional = Optional.empty();
         ```
    2. **Checking For Value Presence:**

       - `isPresent()`: Returns true if the value is present.
       - `ifPresent(Consumer<? super T> consumer)`: Executes the given consumer if a value is present.
       - ```java
          if (nonEmptyOptional.isPresent()) {
             System.out.println(nonEmptyOptional.get());
          }

          nullableOptional.ifPresent(value -> System.out.println(value));
         ```

    3. **Retrieving the Value:**
       - `get()`: Returns the value if present, otherwise throws NoSuchElementException.
       - `orElse(T other)`: Returns the value if present, otherwise returns other.
       - `orElseGet(Supplier<? extends T> other)`: Returns the value if present, otherwise invokes the supplier and returns its result.
       - `orElseThrow(Supplier<? extends X> exceptionSupplier)`: Returns the value if present, otherwise throws an exception created by the supplier.
       - ```java
          String value = nullableOptional.orElse("default");
          String valueFromSupplier = nullableOptional.orElseGet(() -> "default from supplier");
          String valueOrException = nullableOptional.orElseThrow(() -> new IllegalArgumentException("No value present"));
         ```

- **New Date/Time API :**  
   The new date/time API in Java 8, found in the java.time package, offers a comprehensive and consistent approach to handling dates and times. It is designed to overcome the limitations of the old java.util.Date and java.util.Calendar classes.

  - **Key Classes in java.time:**

    1.  **LocalDate, LocalTime, LocalDateTime:**

        - `LocalDate`: Represents a date (year, month, day) without time and timezone.
        - `LocalTime`: Represents a time (hours, minutes, seconds, nanoseconds) without date and timezone.
        - `LocalDateTime`: Represents both date and time without timezone.
        - ```java
           LocalDate date = LocalDate.now();
           LocalTime time = LocalTime.now();
           LocalDateTime dateTime = LocalDateTime.now();

           LocalDate specificDate = LocalDate.of(2024, 6, 13);
           LocalTime specificTime = LocalTime.of(14, 30);
           LocalDateTime specificDateTime = LocalDateTime.of(2024, 6, 13, 14, 30);
          ```

    2.  **ZonedDateTime:**
        - Represents a date and time with a timezone.
        - ```java
           ZonedDateTime zonedDateTime = ZonedDateTime.now();
           ZonedDateTime specificZonedDateTime = ZonedDateTime.of(2024, 6, 13, 14, 30, 0, 0, ZoneId.of("UTC"));
          ```
    3.  **Period and Duration:**
        - `Period`: Represents a date-based amount of time (years, months, days).
        - `Duration`: Represents a time-based amount of time (hours, minutes, seconds, nanoseconds).
        - ```java
           Period period = Period.ofDays(10);
           Duration duration = Duration.ofHours(5);
          ```
    4.  **Formatting and Parsing:**
        - The DateTimeFormatter class is used to format and parse date-time objects.
        - ```java
           DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm");
           String formattedDateTime = specificDateTime.format(formatter);
           LocalDateTime parsedDateTime = LocalDateTime.parse("13-06-2024 14:30", formatter);
          ```

30. **What are the Singleton, Factory, Builder, and Observer design patterns?**

- **Brief :**
  1. **Singleton pattern:** This pattern ensures that only one instance of a class is created and provides a global point of access to that instance.
     - **Key Characteristics:**  
        `Single Instance:` Only one instance of the class is created.  
        `Global Access:` The instance can be accessed globally.
  2. **Factory pattern:** This pattern provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. In Simple terms instead of using new keyword to create class, client will use method of Factory class and define which class object is required and the Factory Class will create that Object and return the object to the client.
     - **Key Characteristics:**  
        `Encapsulation of Object Creation:` The creation logic is encapsulated in the factory.  
        `Abstraction`: Clients use the factory instead of the new keyword.
  3. **Observer pattern:** This pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
     - **Key Characteristics:**  
        `Loose Coupling:` Observers are loosely coupled to the subject.  
        `Dynamic Relationships:` Observers can be added or removed at runtime.
  4. **Builder Pattern:** The Builder pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation. This pattern is particularly useful when an object has many optional parameters.
     - **Key Characteristics:**  
        `Step-by-Step Construction:` Allows incremental construction of the object.  
        `Immutability:` The built object is often immutable.

1.  **When would you use Dependency Injection?**

- Dependency Injection is design pattern used to implement `Inversion of Control (IoC)` for resolving dependencies in an application. In Java, Dependency Injection is commonly used to create loosely coupled code, configuration management, and for code reusability as well. @Autowired in springboot is the best example of Dependency Injection because it adds the depency via loosely couples object of the component/bean.

32. **Explain the JVM architecture.**

- JVM is an computing machine that enables a computer to run Java programs and programs written on other language that are compiled to java bytecode.The JVM architecture is designed to be platform-independent and consists of several components that work together to execute Java applications.
- **Components of JVM Architecture:**

  1. **Class Loader Subsystem:**  
     **Loading:** Loads the class files (.class) into the JVM.  
     **Linking:** Includes verification, preparation, and (optionally) resolution. Verification ensures that the loaded classes comply with the JVM specifications and do not violate security constraints. Preparation allocates memory for class variables and initializes them to default values. Resolution involves replacing symbolic references with direct references.  
     **Initialization:** Initializes static variables and executes static blocks.

  2. **Runtime Data Areas:**  
     **Method Area:** Stores class-level data such as class structure, method data, and runtime constant pool. It is shared among all threads.  
     **Heap:** The runtime data area from which memory for all class instances and arrays is allocated. The heap is also shared among all threads and is the primary area managed by the garbage collector.  
     **Java Stacks:** Each thread has its own Java stack which stores frames. Each frame corresponds to a method call and holds local variables, partial results, and a reference to the constant pool of the methodâ€™s class.  
     **PC (Program Counter) Register:** Each thread has its own PC register that contains the address of the currently executing JVM instruction.  
     **Native Method Stacks:** These stacks are used for native methods written in languages other than Java (e.g., C/C++) and typically interact with the native operating system.

  3. **Execution Engine:**  
     **Interpreter:** Reads and executes bytecode instructions one by one. It is simple but can be slow because it interprets bytecode directly.  
     **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler:** Improves performance by compiling bytecode into native machine code at runtime. Once a method is compiled, the JVM calls the compiled code directly instead of interpreting it.  
     **Garbage Collector:** Manages the automatic memory management process. It identifies and discards objects that are no longer in use to reclaim memory. Various algorithms like Mark-and-Sweep, Generational GC, and G1 GC are used to perform garbage collection.

  4. **Native Interface:**  
     **Java Native Interface (JNI):** Allows Java code running in the JVM to call and be called by native applications and libraries written in other languages like C and C++.  
     **Native Method Libraries:** Provides an interface for Java code to interact with native code. It consists of native methods that the JVM can use to perform specific tasks that are typically platform-specific.

- **Detailed Flow of Execution**  
   **Class Loading:** The class loader subsystem loads class files into the JVM. It starts with the bootstrap class loader, followed by the extension class loader, and finally the application class loader.  
   **Bytecode Verification:** The bytecode verifier checks the loaded class files for security and correctness. It ensures that the code follows Java language rules and doesnâ€™t perform illegal operations.  
   **Memory Allocation:** The JVM allocates memory for class variables in the method area and for objects in the heap. Each thread gets its own stack where method calls are recorded.  
   **Execution:** The execution engine takes bytecode and executes it. The interpreter reads and executes each instruction sequentially, while the JIT compiler compiles frequently executed bytecode into native code for faster execution.  
   **Garbage Collection:** Periodically, the garbage collector runs to free up memory by removing objects that are no longer reachable from any live thread or static fields.

- **Conclusion :**
  The JVM architecture is a sophisticated and robust system designed to run Java applications efficiently and securely. It abstracts the underlying hardware and operating system details, providing a platform-independent execution environment. The combination of the class loader subsystem, runtime data areas, execution engine, and native interface ensures that Java applications are executed smoothly, with automatic memory management and the ability to integrate with native code when necessary.

33. **What are the different types of class loaders?**

- Class Loader in java is responsible for loading class files in jvm during execution and follow a hierarchical delegation model where each class loader has a parent, and the loading request is first delegated to the parent class loader before attempting to load the class itself. There are several types of class loaders, each serving a specific purpose.
- **Types of Class Loaders**

  1. **Bootstrap Class Loader:**
     **Purpose:** This is the root class loader and the parent of all other class loaders. It loads the core Java libraries located in the `JAVA_HOME/lib` directory, such as `rt.jar` which contains the standard Java classes (`java.lang`, `java.util`, etc.).
     **Implementation:** It is implemented in native code (typically in C or C++) and is part of the JVM itself.
     **Visibility:** It is not visible to Java applications and cannot be directly referenced or manipulated by Java code.
  2. **Extension Class Loader (Platform Class Loader in JDK 9 and later):**
     **Purpose:** It loads classes from the extensions directories, typically located in `JAVA_HOME/lib/ext` or any other directory specified by the `java.ext.dirs` system property.
     **Implementation:** It is implemented in Java and extends the `ClassLoader` class.
     **Hierarchy:** It is a child of the bootstrap class loader and a parent to the system/application class loader.
  3. **System/Application Class Loader:**
     **Purpose:** It loads classes from the system classpath, which includes paths specified by the `CLASSPATH` environment variable, `java.class.path` system property, or `-cp` command-line option.
     **Implementation:** It is also implemented in Java and extends the `ClassLoader` class.
     **Hierarchy:** It is a child of the extension class loader.
  4. **Custom Class Loaders**
     In addition to these standard class loaders, developers can create custom class loaders by extending the `ClassLoader` class. Custom class loaders are typically used for:
     **Loading Classes from Non-Standard Sources:** Such as over a network, from a database, or from dynamically generated code.
     **Implementing Specific Class Loading Policies:** Such as reloading classes or loading classes in a specific order.
     **Isolating Classes:** For instance, in application servers or plugin systems where different applications or plugins need to use different versions of the same class.

     **Example:**

     - **Loading Classes From Specified Directory :**

       ```java
       // classes from the specified directory
       import java.io.*;
       import java.nio.file.*;

       public class CustomClassLoader extends ClassLoader {
          private final Path classesDir;

          public CustomClassLoader(Path classesDir) {
             this.classesDir = classesDir;
          }

          @Override
          protected Class<?> findClass(String name) throws ClassNotFoundException {
             Path classFile = classesDir.resolve(name.replace('.', '/') + ".class");
             if (Files.exists(classFile)) {
                   try {
                      byte[] classBytes = Files.readAllBytes(classFile);
                      return defineClass(name, classBytes, 0, classBytes.length);
                   } catch (IOException e) {
                      throw new ClassNotFoundException("Could not load class " + name, e);
                   }
             }
             return super.findClass(name);
          }
       }
       ```

     - **Using the Custom Class Loader**
       ```java
       public class CustomClassLoaderTest {
          public static void main(String[] args) {
             try {
                   Path classesDir = Paths.get("path/to/classes");
                   CustomClassLoader customClassLoader = new CustomClassLoader(classesDir);
                   Class<?> clazz = customClassLoader.loadClass("com.example.MyClass");
                   Object instance = clazz.newInstance();
                   System.out.println("Class loaded: " + clazz.getName());
             } catch (Exception e) {
                   e.printStackTrace();
             }
          }
       }
       ```

34. **How does the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler work?**

- **JIT** is a part of JVM.
- It compiles bytecodes to machine code at runtime.
- Very frequently used methods are compiled once and kept into memory.
- JIT performs some optimization on code.

35. **What are the differences between Java IO and NIO?**

- Java IO(Input/Output) and Java NIO(New Input/Output) are two distinct APIs provided by java for handling input and output. Each API has its own set of classes and methods designed to meet different needs and use cases.
- **Java IO(Tradition IO)**

  1. **Stream Oriented**  
     Java IO operates in a stream-oriented fashion. This means it reads and writes data one byte or character at a time, using `InputStream` and `OutputStream` for byte streams and `Reader` and `Writer` for character streams.
  2. **Blocking IO:**
     Java IO is blocking. When a thread performs a read or write operation, it is blocked until the data is available or the operation is complete. This can lead to inefficiencies, especially in high-concurrency applications.
  3. **No Direct Buffer Management:**
     Java IO does not provide direct control over buffers. Data is generally read into and written from arrays, and the JVM manages the buffers internally.
  4. **File Handling:**
     File handling in Java IO is done through the File class, which provides methods to create, delete, and inspect files and directories. However, it doesn't provide many advanced file operations.
  5. **Less Complex:**
     The traditional IO API is relatively simpler and easier to use for straightforward file and stream operations, making it suitable for basic tasks.

- **Java NIO (New IO)**
  1. **Buffer Oriented:**
     Java NIO operates in a buffer-oriented manner. Data is read into a buffer from which it can be processed. Buffers provide a more flexible and efficient way to handle data.
  2. **Non-Blocking IO:**
     Java NIO supports non-blocking IO. This means threads can initiate an IO operation and continue executing other tasks while the IO operation completes in the background. This is particularly useful for building scalable and high-performance applications.
  3. **Selectors:**
     NIO introduces the concept of selectors, which allow a single thread to monitor multiple channels (like sockets) for events (such as data ready to read or write). This reduces the need for multiple threads and can improve resource management.
  4. **Channels:**
     Java NIO uses channels (`FileChannel`, `SocketChannel`, `DatagramChannel`, etc.) for IO operations. Channels provide a unified way to read from and write to files, sockets, and other IO sources.
  5. **Advanced File Handling:**
     NIO includes the `java.nio.file` package, which offers the `Path`, `Files`, and `FileSystem` classes. These provide more advanced file operations, such as symbolic links, file attributes, and file system operations.
  6. **Direct Buffer Management:**
     NIO allows for direct buffer management. Direct buffers can be allocated outside of the JVM's heap memory, providing potentially faster IO operations due to reduced copying of data between the JVM and the OS.
  7. **More Complex:**
     The NIO API is more complex compared to the traditional IO API. It requires a better understanding of concepts like buffers, channels, and selectors, which can be more challenging for beginners.
- **Summary of Differences:**

  | **Use Cases**         | Suitable for simple IO tasks      | Suitable for high-performance, scalable apps |

- **When to Use Java IO vs. Java NIO**
  - **Java IO:**
    - Use for simple and straightforward IO tasks where performance is not a critical concern.
    - suitable for application with low to moderate concurrency requirements.
    - Easier to use and understand, beginners-friendly for simple applications.
  - **Java NIO:**
    - Use for high performance, scalable applications, such as servers handling many simultaneous connections.
    - Suitable for scenarios requiring non-blocking IO and advanced file operations.
    - Requires a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts but provides greater control and efficiency.

36. **Explain the use of buffers and channels in NIO.**

- **Buffers:** Act as containers for data, managing it efficiently between the IO operations and the application logic. They provide methods for reading and writing data and managing the state of the buffer.
- **Channels:** Represent connections to IO resources and support reading and writing operations, often in a non-blocking manner. They work directly with buffers to facilitate efficient data transfer.

These two are the fundamental components of the NIO that works together to provide efficient, scalable, non-blocking IO operations.

- **Buffers:** A buffer is a container for a fixed amount of data of a specific primitive type (e.g., byte, char, int). It is a crucial component in the NIO API, designed for managing data transfers between channels and the rest of the application.
  - **Key Characteristics of Buffers:**
    1. **Types of Buffers:**
       - `ByteBuffer`, `CharBuffer`, `IntBuffer`, `FloatBuffer`, etc.
       - The most commonly used buffer is ByteBuffer.
    2. **Buffer Operations:**
       - **put():** Writes data into the buffer.
       - **get():** Reads data from the buffer.
       - **flip():** Prepares the buffer for reading data (switches from writing mode to reading mode).
       - **rewind():** Resets the buffer's position to the beginning for re-reading the data.
       - **clear():** Clears the buffer for writing data again (resets position and limits but doesn't clear the actual data).
       - **compact():** Clears the buffer but preserves any unread data.
    3. **Buffer Properties:**
       - **Capacity:** The maximum number of elements the buffer can hold.
       - **Position:** The index of the next element to be read or written.
       - **Limit:** The index of the first element that should not be read or written.
       - **Mark:** A marker used to remember a specific position within the buffer.
- **Channels:** A channel represents an open connection to an IO resource, such as a file, socket, or device. Channels provide a way to perform both read and write operations.

  - **Key Characteristics of Channels:**
    1.  **Types of Channels:**
        - **FileChannel:** For reading from and writing to files.
        - **SocketChannel:** For reading from and writing to network sockets.
        - **ServerSocketChannel:** For listening to incoming socket connections.
        - **DatagramChannel:** For reading and writing datagram packets.
    2.  **Non-Blocking IO:**
        - Channels can be configured in non-blocking mode, allowing IO operations to be performed asynchronously. This is particularly useful for applications that need to handle many simultaneous connections.
    3.  **Direct Interaction with Buffers:**
        - Channels read data into buffers and write data from buffers. This interaction makes data handling efficient and flexible.

- **Sample Program:** demonstrating how to use a `FileChannel` to read data from a file into a `ByteBuffer`:

```java
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.ByteBuffer;
import java.nio.channels.FileChannel;

public class NIOExample {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      try (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("input.txt");
            FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("output.txt");
            FileChannel readChannel = fis.getChannel();
            FileChannel writeChannel = fos.getChannel()) {

            // Allocate a buffer with a capacity of 1024 bytes
            ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);

            // Read data from the channel into the buffer
            while (readChannel.read(buffer) > 0) {
               // Flip the buffer to prepare for reading data from it
               buffer.flip();
               // Write data from the buffer to the channel
               writeChannel.write(buffer);
               // Clear the buffer to make it ready for writing again
               buffer.clear();
            }

      } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
      }
   }
}
```

37. **How do you implement serialization and deserialization in Java?**

- Serialization and deserialization in Java are processes that allow you to convert objects to a byte stream and back, enabling you to save objects to files, send them over a network, or store them in a database. Java provides built-in support for serialization through the java.io.Serializable interface and the ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream classes.
- **Implementing Serialization and Deserialization**

  1. **Marking a Class Serializable:**
     To make a class serializable, you need to implement the Serializable interface. This is a marker interface, meaning it does not contain any methods; it simply marks the class as capable of being serialized.

     ```java
     import java.io.Serializable;

     public class Person implements Serializable {
        private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

        private String name;
        private int age;

        public Person(String name, int age) {
           this.name = name;
           this.age = age;
        }

        // Getters and setters
        public String getName() {
           return name;
        }

        public void setName(String name) {
           this.name = name;
        }

        public int getAge() {
           return age;
        }

        public void setAge(int age) {
           this.age = age;
        }

        @Override
        public String toString() {
           return "Person{name='" + name + "', age=" + age + '}';
        }
     }
     ```

  2. **Serializing an Object :**
     Serialization involves converting an object into a byte stream so that it can be written to a file or sent over a network. You use `ObjectOutputStream` to write the object to a file or other output stream.

     ```java
     import java.io.FileOutputStream;
     import java.io.IOException;
     import java.io.ObjectOutputStream;

     public class SerializeExample {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
           Person person = new Person("John Doe", 30);

           try (FileOutputStream fileOut = new FileOutputStream("person.ser");
                 ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(fileOut)) {

                 out.writeObject(person);
                 System.out.println("Serialized data is saved in person.ser");

           } catch (IOException i) {
                 i.printStackTrace();
           }
        }
     }
     ```

  3. **Deserializing an Object :**
     Deserialization involves converting a byte stream back into a copy of the original object. You use `ObjectInputStream` to read the object from a file or other input stream.

     ```java
     import java.io.FileInputStream;
     import java.io.IOException;
     import java.io.ObjectInputStream;

     public class DeserializeExample {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
           Person person = null;

           try (FileInputStream fileIn = new FileInputStream("person.ser");
                 ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(fileIn)) {

                 person = (Person) in.readObject();
                 System.out.println("Deserialized Person:");
                 System.out.println(person);

           } catch (IOException | ClassNotFoundException i) {
                 i.printStackTrace();
           }
        }
     }
     ```

     **Key Points :**

     - **Serializable Interface:** Classes that need to be serialized must implement the Serializable interface.
     - **serialVersionUID:** A unique identifier for each serializable class. It helps in version control of classes. If no serialVersionUID is explicitly defined, the JVM will compute one at runtime, which can lead to InvalidClassException if the class structure changes.
     - **Transient Keyword:** Fields marked with the transient keyword are not serialized. Use this keyword for sensitive information that you don't want to save or send.

  4. **Custom Serialization:** If you need more control over the serialization process, you can define the following methods in your class:

  - `private void writeObject(ObjectOutputStream out) throws IOException`
  - `private void readObject(ObjectInputStream in) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException`

  ```java
  import java.io.IOException;
  import java.io.ObjectInputStream;
  import java.io.ObjectOutputStream;
  import java.io.Serializable;

  public class Person implements Serializable {
     private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

     private String name;
     private int age;
     private transient String password; // This will not be serialized

     public Person(String name, int age, String password) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.password = password;
     }

     private void writeObject(ObjectOutputStream out) throws IOException {
        out.defaultWriteObject();
        out.writeObject(encryptPassword(password)); // Custom serialization for password
     }

     private void readObject(ObjectInputStream in) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
        in.defaultReadObject();
        this.password = decryptPassword((String) in.readObject()); // Custom deserialization for password
     }

     private String encryptPassword(String password) {
        // Simple encryption logic (for demonstration purposes only)
        return new StringBuilder(password).reverse().toString();
     }

     private String decryptPassword(String encryptedPassword) {
        // Simple decryption logic (for demonstration purposes only)
        return new StringBuilder(encryptedPassword).reverse().toString();
     }

     // Getters, setters, and toString methods
  }
  ```

38. **What are the different types of references in Java?**

- There are several types of references that determine how objects are treated by the garbage collector and whether they are eligible for garbage collection. These reference types help manage memory efficiently and handle object lifecycle appropriately. Here are the main types of references in Java:

  1. **Strong References**

     - **Normal References:** These are the most common type of references in Java. When an object is referenced by at least one strong reference, it is considered reachable and not eligible for garbage collection.
     - **Example:** `Object obj = new Object();`

  2. **Weak References**

     - **WeakReference:** Objects that are only weakly referenced are eligible for garbage collection if there are no strong references pointing to them. They are useful for implementing memory-sensitive caches and data structures.
     - **Example:** `WeakReference<Object> weakRef = new WeakReference<>(obj);`

  3. **Soft References**

     - **SoftReference:** Objects referenced by soft references are only cleared by the garbage collector when memory is low and before throwing an OutOfMemoryError. They are typically used for caching data that can be discarded when memory is needed.
     - **Example:** `SoftReference<Object> softRef = new SoftReference<>(obj);`

  4. **Phantom References**

     - **PhantomReference:** Phantom references are enqueued in a reference queue after the object to which they refer has been finalized but before its memory has been reclaimed. They are used for implementing cleanup actions or logging before an object is garbage collected.
     - **Example:** `PhantomReference<Object> phantomRef = new PhantomReference<>(obj, referenceQueue);`

  5. **Final References**

     - **FinalReference:** Final references are used internally by the JVM for finalization. They are not directly accessible in Java code but play a role in the finalization process.
     - **Example:** Not directly accessible in Java code.

**Reference Queues**
In addition to the above reference types, Java provides reference queues (ReferenceQueue) to support automatic cleanup actions or logging when objects become unreachable. Reference queues are associated with weak, soft, and phantom references, allowing you to receive notifications when these references become eligible for garbage collection.

**Summary** - **Strong References:** Keep objects alive until explicitly released or no longer referenced. - **Weak References:** Allow objects to be garbage collected when not strongly referenced. - **Soft References:** Allow objects to be garbage collected when memory is low. - **Phantom References:** Allow cleanup actions to be performed before objects are garbage collected. - **Final References:** Used internally by the JVM for finalization purposes. - **Reference Queues:** Allow tracking of reference objects before they are garbage collected.
