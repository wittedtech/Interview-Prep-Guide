Now provide solutions and answers of all these questions. Answers must be in depth and summarised so that i can properly read and understand every concept properly.

ChatGPT: 

Let's dive into detailed explanations and solutions for each question. I will structure the answers to ensure they cover key concepts and give you a clear understanding of Java multithreading.
**Basic Concepts**  
1. **What is multithreading in Java, and how is it different from multitasking?**  
  - **Multithreading**  allows multiple threads to run concurrently within a program. Each thread runs independently, but shares the same memory space. **Multitasking**  is a broader concept where the system runs multiple tasks (processes or threads) at the same time, but processes have their own memory space.

  - In multithreading, threads within the same process share resources, making context-switching cheaper than in multitasking.
 
2. **How can you create a thread in Java?**  
  - **Two ways**  to create a thread: 
    1. **Extending the `Thread` class** :

```Copy code
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running");
    }
}
```
 
      - Simply extend the `Thread` class and override the `run()` method.
 
    2. **Implementing `Runnable` interface** :

```Copy code
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running");
    }
}
```
 
      - This is preferred as Java does not support multiple inheritance, and `Runnable` allows you to extend other classes.
 
3. **What are the different thread states in Java?**  
  - **Thread States** : 
    1. **New** : Thread created but not yet started.
 
    2. **Runnable** : Thread is executing or ready to execute.
 
    3. **Blocked** : Waiting for a monitor lock (in case of `synchronized` blocks).
 
    4. **Waiting** : Waiting indefinitely for another thread’s action (`wait()`).
 
    5. **Timed Waiting** : Waiting for a specified time (`sleep()`, `join(long)`).
 
    6. **Terminated** : Thread has completed execution.
 
4. **What is the `run()` and `start()` method in a thread?**  
  - **`run()`** : Defines the task the thread will execute when it's started.
 
  - **`start()`** : Creates a new thread and then invokes the `run()` method internally. Calling `run()` directly won’t start a new thread, it will be executed on the main thread.
 
5. **How do you control thread execution (sleep, yield, and join)?**  
  - **`sleep()`** : Pauses the thread for a specified time.
 
  - **`yield()`** : Hints to the scheduler that the current thread is willing to yield its current use of the CPU.
 
  - **`join()`** : Waits for the thread to die before proceeding.
 
6. **What is thread priority in Java?** 
  - Thread priority is an integer from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest). The thread with higher priority is more likely to be picked by the scheduler, but this is not guaranteed.
 
7. **What are daemon threads in Java?**  
  - **Daemon threads**  are background threads (e.g., garbage collector). They terminate when all user threads have finished. You can set a thread as a daemon using `setDaemon(true)`.
 
8. **What is the significance of the `synchronized` keyword?**  
  - The `synchronized` keyword ensures that only one thread can access a block of code at a time, preventing race conditions. It can be used on methods or blocks of code to achieve mutual exclusion. 
    - **Method synchronization** : Locks the entire object.
 
    - **Block synchronization** : Locks a specific object.
**Intermediate Concepts**  
1. **What are race conditions? How do you handle them in Java?**  
  - A **race condition**  occurs when two or more threads access shared resources concurrently, leading to inconsistent data. Race conditions are avoided using synchronization (`synchronized` keyword, locks).
 
2. **Explain how to achieve inter-thread communication in Java.**  
  - Java provides **Java provides `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()`**  for inter-thread communication. 
    - `wait()` causes a thread to release the lock and wait until another thread calls `notify()` or `notifyAll()`.
 
    - `notify()` wakes up one waiting thread.
 
    - `notifyAll()` wakes up all waiting threads.
 
3. **What are deadlocks in multithreading, and how can you prevent them?**  
  - A **deadlock**  occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other. Deadlocks can be prevented by: 
    - **Avoiding nested locks** .
 
    - Using a **lock ordering**  strategy.
 
    - Using **tryLock()**  method in `ReentrantLock`.
 
4. **How does `synchronized` block differ from `synchronized` method?**  
  - **Synchronized block** : More granular, locks only the specified object.
 
  - **Synchronized method** : Locks the entire object (or class if static).
 
5. **What is a reentrant lock in Java, and how is it different from `synchronized`?**  
  - **ReentrantLock**  is part of `java.util.concurrent.locks` and provides more advanced locking mechanisms like fairness, timeouts, and interruptibility, which `synchronized` lacks.
 
6. **What are thread pools? Why are they important?**  
  - A **thread pool**  manages a set of reusable threads to execute tasks. It reduces the overhead of thread creation and destruction, making it efficient for handling a large number of tasks.
 
7. **Explain how to implement a thread pool using the `ExecutorService` framework.**  
  - Java provides `ExecutorService` for managing thread pools.

```Copy code
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
executor.submit(() -> System.out.println("Task running"));
executor.shutdown();
```
 
8. **What is the `Callable` interface, and how is it different from `Runnable`?**  
  - `Callable` can return a result and throw checked exceptions, whereas `Runnable` cannot.

```Copy code
Callable<Integer> task = () -> {
    return 42;
};
```
 
9. **How do you implement the producer-consumer problem using Java’s multithreading features?**  
  - You can implement it using **BlockingQueue**  to avoid manual synchronization.

```Copy code
BlockingQueue<Integer> queue = new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(10);
```
 
10. **What is a `Future` and `CompletableFuture`?**  
  - **Future** : Represents the result of an asynchronous computation. You can check if it’s done and retrieve the result.
 
  - **CompletableFuture** : Enhances `Future` by allowing chaining of multiple async tasks and combining results.
 
11. **Explain the purpose of `ThreadLocal` in Java.**  
  - **ThreadLocal**  ensures that each thread has its own isolated copy of a variable.

```Copy code
ThreadLocal<Integer> threadLocal = ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -> 1);
```
 
12. **What is the `CountDownLatch` and `CyclicBarrier`?**  
  - **CountDownLatch** : Allows one or more threads to wait until a set of operations finish.
 
  - **CyclicBarrier** : Allows a set of threads to wait at a barrier point before all of them proceed.
**Advanced Concepts**  
1. **What is a `ReadWriteLock`, and how does it improve performance over `ReentrantLock`?**  
  - **ReadWriteLock**  allows multiple threads to read concurrently while ensuring exclusive access for writing. It improves performance when there are frequent read operations and infrequent writes.
 
2. **What are fork-join pools, and how do they differ from regular thread pools?**  
  - **Fork-Join Pool** : Specialized for recursive divide-and-conquer tasks. It uses work-stealing, where idle threads can take tasks from busy threads.
 
3. **What is a `Semaphore`, and when would you use it in Java?**  
  - A **Semaphore**  limits the number of threads that can access a shared resource. For example, it can be used to control access to a limited pool of resources like database connections.
 
4. **Explain the concept of a `Phaser` in Java.**  
  - **Phaser**  allows threads to synchronize in phases. Unlike `CyclicBarrier`, it allows dynamic registration of parties.
 
5. **What is `Exchanger` in Java multithreading, and how does it work?**  
  - **Exchanger**  allows two threads to exchange data at a synchronization point.
 
6. **What is the `volatile` keyword, and how is it used in multithreading?**  
  - **Volatile**  ensures that the variable's value is always read from the main memory, preventing the caching of variables in threads, and is useful for flags or simple state tracking.
 
7. **How do you avoid `Thread` safety issues when multiple threads access shared resources?**  
  - Use synchronization mechanisms such as `synchronized`, locks, atomic variables, or thread-safe collections (e.g., `ConcurrentHashMap`).
 
8. **What is the Java Memory Model (JMM), and how does it affect multithreading?**  
  - The **Java Memory Model (JMM)**  defines how threads interact through memory and how changes made by one thread become visible to others. It governs visibility and ordering of operations.
 
9. **How do `Atomic` classes like `AtomicInteger`, `AtomicLong` work in Java?**  
  - **Atomic classes**  perform thread-safe operations using low-level hardware instructions like Compare-And-Swap (CAS) without locking.

```Copy code
AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);
count.incrementAndGet();
```
 
10. **Explain the `CompletableFuture` chaining and combining multiple async tasks.**  
  - **CompletableFuture**  allows chaining tasks using `thenApply`, `thenCompose`, `thenCombine`, and handling exceptions asynchronously.

```Copy code
CompletableFuture<Integer> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> 42)
        .thenApply(result -> result * 2);
```
 
11. **What is the difference between `invokeAll()` and `invokeAny()` methods in `ExecutorService`?**  
  - **`invokeAll()`** : Executes all tasks and waits for their completion.
 
  - **`invokeAny()`** : Returns the result of the first task that completes successfully.
 
12. **How can you cancel a thread in Java, and what is the correct way to do it?**  
  - Java threads can be interrupted using `interrupt()` method. The thread must regularly check `Thread.interrupted()` to respond to interruption. Avoid using `stop()` as it is deprecated and unsafe.
 
13. **How would you design a thread-safe singleton in Java?**  
  - Use **double-checked locking**  with `synchronized` and `volatile`.

```Copy code
public class Singleton {
    private static volatile Singleton instance;
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (Singleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new Singleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```
 
14. **Explain the concept of a non-blocking algorithm and `Compare-And-Swap (CAS)` in Java.**  
  - Non-blocking algorithms allow threads to proceed without being blocked, using techniques like **CAS** . CAS compares the current value with an expected value and only updates if they match, ensuring thread safety without locks.
 
15. **What are `Lock` and `Condition` interfaces, and how are they used in advanced multithreading?**  
  - **`Lock`**  provides finer-grained locking over `synchronized`, and ****`Lock`**  provides finer-grained locking over `synchronized`, and `Condition`**  allows threads to wait and be notified (similar to `wait/notify` but with more control).
 
16. **Explain how the `StampedLock` class differs from `ReentrantLock` and `ReadWriteLock`.**  
  - **StampedLock**  supports optimistic reads (without locking) and offers improved performance for read-dominant workloads, compared to traditional read-write locks.
 
17. **How would you implement a custom thread pool in Java?**  
  - You can implement a custom thread pool using `BlockingQueue` for task submission and worker threads to execute tasks. Alternatively, extend `ThreadPoolExecutor`.
 
18. **What is thread starvation, and how do you handle it?**  
  - **Thread starvation**  occurs when low-priority threads never get CPU time. It can be avoided by fair scheduling (e.g., using `ReentrantLock(true)` for fair locking).
 
19. **What is the Fork/Join framework?**  
  - The **Fork/Join framework**  is used for parallel processing in recursive tasks, where large tasks are divided into smaller subtasks (forked), and results are combined (joined). It’s part of `java.util.concurrent`.
 
20. **Discuss different types of liveness issues in Java multithreading (deadlock, livelock, starvation).**  
  - **Deadlock** : Two or more threads are blocked, waiting for each other.
 
  - **Livelock** : Threads are active but unable to make progress.
 
  - **Starvation** : Threads are perpetually denied access to resources.
**Real-Life Scenarios & Project-Based Questions**  
1. **How would you design a multithreaded web server using Java?**  
  - A multithreaded web server can be built using a **thread pool**  to handle multiple requests concurrently. Each client request can be processed by a separate thread from the pool.
 
2. **How would you handle thousands of concurrent users in a system?**  
  - Use **thread pools**  and asynchronous processing (`CompletableFuture`, `ExecutorService`) to handle multiple users efficiently.
 
3. **How would you use thread pools to optimize a high-load system like a messaging platform?** 
  - By maintaining a fixed pool of threads, you can avoid the overhead of creating new threads and use queues to distribute tasks evenly among worker threads.
 
4. **Design a system that processes data from multiple sources (e.g., logs, streams) concurrently.**  
  - Use **Use `ExecutorService`**  for parallel processing, and **Use **Use `ExecutorService`**  for parallel processing, and `BlockingQueue`**  for inter-thread communication. Each source can be handled by a separate thread that pushes data into a shared queue.
 
5. **How would you optimize a multi-threaded file processing system?**

Ensure thread-safe access to shared resources (e.g., files) and consider using `FileChannel`**  for efficient I/O.
 
6. **Implement a multithreaded event-driven system using Java's `CompletableFuture`.**  
  - **`CompletableFuture`**  can be used for handling events asynchronously. Chain event processing using `thenApply`, `thenRun`, and handle failures with `exceptionally`.
 
7. **In a real-time trading application, how would you manage order matching in a multithreaded way?**  
  - Use a combination of **concurrent data structures**  (like `ConcurrentHashMap`) for matching, and thread-safe algorithms to ensure consistency in order processing.
 
8. **How would you handle concurrent access to a database in a multithreaded application?**  
  - Use **connection pools**  (e.g., HikariCP), ensure transactions are handled correctly, and consider **optimistic locking**  strategies to avoid conflicts.

I will now provide detailed solutions with code implementations for the **Real-Life Scenarios & Project-Based Questions** . Each solution will include both the concept and complete code where necessary.**41. How would you design a multithreaded web server using Java?** **Solution Explanation:** 
A multithreaded web server handles multiple client requests concurrently. The core idea is to:
 
- Use a **thread pool**  to limit the number of active threads (which prevents overwhelming the server with too many requests).
 
- Create a **server socket**  to listen for incoming client connections.

- For each incoming connection, a worker thread from the pool processes the request.
**Code Implementation:** 

```Copy code
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class MultiThreadedWebServer {
    
    private static final int PORT = 8080;
    private static final int THREAD_POOL_SIZE = 10;

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        // Create a thread pool
        ExecutorService threadPool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(THREAD_POOL_SIZE);
        ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(PORT);

        System.out.println("Server started on port: " + PORT);

        while (true) {
            try {
                // Accept new client connection
                Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();
                // Submit client handling to the thread pool
                threadPool.submit(() -> handleClient(clientSocket));
            } catch (IOException e) {
                System.out.println("Error accepting client connection: " + e.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }

    private static void handleClient(Socket clientSocket) {
        try (BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(clientSocket.getInputStream()));
             PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(clientSocket.getOutputStream(), true)) {
             
            // Read client request
            String requestLine = in.readLine();
            System.out.println("Received request: " + requestLine);

            // Send response
            out.println("HTTP/1.1 200 OK");
            out.println("Content-Type: text/plain");
            out.println();
            out.println("Hello! This is a multithreaded server.");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Error handling client: " + e.getMessage());
        } finally {
            try {
                clientSocket.close();
            } catch (IOException e) {
                System.out.println("Error closing client socket: " + e.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
1. **ServerSocket**  listens on port 8080.
 
2. A **thread pool**  with a fixed size (10 threads) is created using `Executors.newFixedThreadPool()`.

3. When a client connects, a new task (handling client) is submitted to the thread pool.

4. The client is handled by reading the HTTP request and sending a simple "Hello!" response.

5. The server runs continuously, handling multiple clients concurrently.

**42. How would you handle thousands of concurrent users in a system?** **Solution Explanation:** 
Handling thousands of concurrent users requires efficient management of threads and resources. Some approaches:
 
1. **Thread Pooling** : Use thread pools to limit the number of active threads.
 
2. **Non-blocking I/O** : Instead of blocking I/O, use **Java NIO**  (Non-blocking I/O) or asynchronous processing to handle I/O operations efficiently.
 
3. **Load Balancing** : Distribute the load across multiple server instances.
**Code Implementation (Using Thread Pooling and NIO):**

            ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);
            int bytesRead = clientChannel.read(buffer);
            
            if (bytesRead > 0) {
                // Process the client's data (request)
                buffer.flip();
                byte[] data = new byte[bytesRead];
                buffer.get(data);
                String clientRequest = new String(data);
                System.out.println("Received request: " + clientRequest);
                
                // Send response
                buffer.clear();
                buffer.put("Hello! You are connected to the NIO server.".getBytes());
                buffer.flip();
                clientChannel.write(buffer);
            } else if (bytesRead == -1) {
                // Close connection if client disconnected
                clientChannel.close();
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Error handling client: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- **Non-blocking I/O (NIO)**  allows the server to handle thousands of concurrent connections by avoiding blocking on I/O operations.
 
- A **selector**  monitors multiple channels (client connections) for events like new client connection or incoming data.

- When a client connects, the server registers the connection and listens for data.
 
- The **thread pool**  is used to handle read operations and respond to clients.

**43. How would you use thread pools to optimize a high-load system like a messaging platform?** **Solution Explanation:** 
In a messaging platform, each message must be processed concurrently while minimizing overhead. Using a thread pool allows the system to:

1. Efficiently manage threads by limiting their number.

2. Queue tasks (messages) when all threads are busy.

3. Utilize worker threads to process incoming messages, ensuring high throughput.
**Code Implementation (Messaging System with Thread Pool):** 

```Copy code
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class MessagingPlatform {
    
    private static final int THREAD_POOL_SIZE = 10;
    private static final int MESSAGE_QUEUE_CAPACITY = 50;
    
    // Thread pool for handling messages
    private static ExecutorService messageProcessorPool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(THREAD_POOL_SIZE);
    // BlockingQueue to hold incoming messages
    private static BlockingQueue<String> messageQueue = new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(MESSAGE_QUEUE_CAPACITY);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Simulate message sending
        for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
            String message = "Message #" + i;
            messageQueue.offer(message);
            System.out.println("Queued: " + message);
        }
        
        // Start message processing in thread pool
        for (int i = 0; i < THREAD_POOL_SIZE; i++) {
            messageProcessorPool.submit(() -> {
                while (true) {
                    try {
                        // Retrieve and process the next message
                        String message = messageQueue.take(); // Blocking until message is available
                        processMessage(message);
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                    }
                }
            });
        }
    }

    private static void processMessage(String message) {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is processing: " + message);
        try {
            Thread.sleep(100); // Simulate processing time
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- **Thread pool**  (`ExecutorService`) is used to process messages.
 
- **BlockingQueue**  (`ArrayBlockingQueue`) holds the incoming messages, ensuring they are processed one by one.

- Each thread in the pool continuously processes messages from the queue.

**44. Design a system that processes data from multiple sources (e.g., logs, streams) concurrently.** **Solution Explanation:** 
To process data concurrently from multiple sources (e.g., logs or streams), we can:

1. Create a separate thread for each data source to read data concurrently.
 
2. Use a **BlockingQueue**  to collect the data from each source.

3. Process the data in separate threads, ensuring non-blocking processing of each stream.
**Code Implementation:** 

```Copy code
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class DataProcessingSystem {
    
    private static final int QUEUE_CAPACITY = 50;
    private static final int THREAD_POOL_SIZE = 5;

    // BlockingQueue to collect data from sources
    private static BlockingQueue<String> dataQueue = new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(QUEUE_CAPACITY);
    // Thread pool to process data
    private static ExecutorService dataProcessorPool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(THREAD_POOL_SIZE);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Simulate data sources
        startDataSource("Log Source 1");
        startDataSource("Log Source 2");
        startDataSource("Stream Source 1");

        // Start data processing in the thread pool
        for (int i = 0; i < THREAD_POOL_SIZE; i++) {
            dataProcessorPool.submit(() -> {
                while (true) {
                    try {
                        // Retrieve and process data from the queue
                        String data = dataQueue.take(); // Blocking until data is available
                        processData(data);
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                    }
                }
            });
        }
    }

    private static void startDataSource(String sourceName) {
        // Create a thread for each data source to simulate data generation
        new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
                String data = sourceName + " - Data #" + i;
                try {
                    dataQueue.put(data); // Blocking if the queue is full
                    System.out.println("Produced: " + data);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                }
            }
        }).start();
    }

    private static void processData(String data) {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " processing: " + data);
        try {
            Thread.sleep(50); // Simulate data processing time
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- **BlockingQueue**  collects data from multiple sources (simulated as log or stream sources).

- Each data source runs in a separate thread, continuously adding data to the queue.
 
- A **thread pool**  processes the data from the queue concurrently.

**45. How would you optimize a multi-threaded file processing system?** **Solution Explanation:** 
A file processing system can be optimized by:
 
1. **Reading file chunks**  in parallel using multiple threads.
 
2. Using **FileChannel**  for efficient I/O operations.
 
3. **Thread-safe access**  to shared resources like file readers and writers.
**Code Implementation:** 

```Copy code
import java.io.*;
import java.nio.*;
import java.nio.channels.*;
import java.nio.file.*;
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class FileProcessingSystem {
    
    private static final int THREAD_POOL_SIZE = 4;
    private static final int BUFFER_SIZE = 1024;

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        ExecutorService fileProcessorPool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(THREAD_POOL_SIZE);
        
        // File to be processed
        Path filePath = Paths.get("largefile.txt");
        FileChannel fileChannel = FileChannel.open(filePath, StandardOpenOption.READ);
        long fileSize = Files.size(filePath);
        
        // Calculate chunk size and assign chunks to different threads
        long chunkSize = fileSize / THREAD_POOL_SIZE;
        for (int i = 0; i < THREAD_POOL_SIZE; i++) {
            long startPosition = i * chunkSize;
            long endPosition = (i == THREAD_POOL_SIZE - 1) ? fileSize : (i + 1) * chunkSize;
            fileProcessorPool.submit(() -> processFileChunk(fileChannel, startPosition, endPosition));
        }

        fileProcessorPool.shutdown();
    }

    private static void processFileChunk(FileChannel fileChannel, long startPosition, long endPosition) {
        try {
            ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(BUFFER_SIZE);
            fileChannel.position(startPosition);
            while (fileChannel.position() < endPosition) {
                int bytesRead = fileChannel.read(buffer);
                if (bytesRead == -1) break;
                buffer.flip();
                
                // Simulate processing of file chunk
                while (buffer.hasRemaining()) {
                    System.out.print((char) buffer.get());
                }
                
                buffer.clear();
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Error processing file chunk: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```
**Explanation:** 
- The file is split into chunks, each handled by a separate thread.
 
- **FileChannel**  is used for efficient, direct file access.

- Threads read from different parts of the file concurrently, improving performance.

**46. Implement a multithreaded event-driven system using Java's `CompletableFuture`.** **Solution Explanation:** An event-driven system processes events asynchronously, often using a non-blocking, reactive model. In Java, `CompletableFuture` provides a powerful way to manage asynchronous computations and events. Multiple stages (events) can be chained together, executed concurrently, or handled based on completion.**Code Implementation:** 

```Copy code
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class EventDrivenSystem {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Simulate an event-driven system with CompletableFuture
        CompletableFuture<Void> eventSystem = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            // Stage 1: Simulate event generation
            String event = generateEvent();
            System.out.println("Event generated: " + event);
            return event;
        }).thenApplyAsync(event -> {
            // Stage 2: Simulate event processing
            String processedEvent = processEvent(event);
            System.out.println("Event processed: " + processedEvent);
            return processedEvent;
        }).thenAcceptAsync(processedEvent -> {
            // Stage 3: Simulate event handling
            handleEvent(processedEvent);
        }).exceptionally(ex -> {
            // Handle any exceptions
            System.out.println("Error in event-driven system: " + ex.getMessage());
            return null;
        });

        // Wait for all tasks to finish
        eventSystem.join();
    }

    // Simulate event generation
    private static String generateEvent() {
        return "User_Login_Event";
    }

    // Simulate event processing
    private static String processEvent(String event) {
        return event + "_Processed";
    }

    // Simulate event handling
    private static void handleEvent(String processedEvent) {
        System.out.println("Handling processed event: " + processedEvent);
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- **Event generation, processing, and handling**  are each executed asynchronously using `CompletableFuture`.
 
- The method `thenApplyAsync()` is used for processing and chaining tasks asynchronously.
 
- In case of errors, the system handles exceptions using the `exceptionally()` method.
 
- `CompletableFuture` allows the chaining of events, which can be extended for complex event-driven systems like user actions, notifications, etc.

**47. In a real-time trading application, how would you manage order matching in a multithreaded way?** **Solution Explanation:** 
Order matching in a trading application involves matching buy/sell orders in real-time. To handle concurrent order submissions and ensure thread safety, we can:
 
1. Use **concurrent data structures**  like `ConcurrentHashMap` to store orders.
 
2. Implement a **matching engine**  that processes orders and matches them based on the market price.

3. Ensure thread-safe access to shared resources like the order book using locks if necessary.
**Code Implementation:** 

```Copy code
import java.util.concurrent.*;
import java.util.*;

public class TradingApplication {

    private static final ConcurrentMap<String, PriorityQueue<Order>> buyOrders = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
    private static final ConcurrentMap<String, PriorityQueue<Order>> sellOrders = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);

        // Simulate order submissions
        executorService.submit(() -> submitOrder("AAPL", 150, "BUY", 100));
        executorService.submit(() -> submitOrder("AAPL", 149, "SELL", 50));
        executorService.submit(() -> submitOrder("AAPL", 151, "BUY", 200));
        executorService.submit(() -> submitOrder("AAPL", 148, "SELL", 150));

        executorService.shutdown();
    }

    private static void submitOrder(String symbol, double price, String type, int quantity) {
        Order order = new Order(symbol, price, type, quantity);

        if ("BUY".equals(type)) {
            buyOrders.computeIfAbsent(symbol, k -> new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.reverseOrder())).offer(order);
        } else {
            sellOrders.computeIfAbsent(symbol, k -> new PriorityQueue<>()).offer(order);
        }

        matchOrders(symbol);
    }

    private static synchronized void matchOrders(String symbol) {
        PriorityQueue<Order> buys = buyOrders.get(symbol);
        PriorityQueue<Order> sells = sellOrders.get(symbol);

        while (buys != null && !buys.isEmpty() && sells != null && !sells.isEmpty()) {
            Order highestBuy = buys.peek();
            Order lowestSell = sells.peek();

            if (highestBuy.getPrice() >= lowestSell.getPrice()) {
                // Match orders
                System.out.println("Matched " + highestBuy.getQuantity() + " shares of " + symbol
                        + " at price " + lowestSell.getPrice());
                buys.poll();
                sells.poll();
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    // Order class
    static class Order implements Comparable<Order> {
        private String symbol;
        private double price;
        private String type;
        private int quantity;

        public Order(String symbol, double price, String type, int quantity) {
            this.symbol = symbol;
            this.price = price;
            this.type = type;
            this.quantity = quantity;
        }

        public double getPrice() {
            return price;
        }

        public int getQuantity() {
            return quantity;
        }

        @Override
        public int compareTo(Order other) {
            return Double.compare(this.price, other.price);
        }
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- **Concurrent data structures**  (`ConcurrentHashMap`) store buy and sell orders separately.
 
- **PriorityQueue**  sorts orders based on price to ensure the highest buy and lowest sell prices are matched first.

- The order matching logic runs in a multithreaded environment, ensuring concurrent order submissions are processed correctly.
 
- **Synchronization**  ensures that matching of orders happens atomically to avoid race conditions.

**48. How would you handle concurrent access to a database in a multithreaded application?** **Solution Explanation:** 
In a multithreaded environment, multiple threads may access the database concurrently. To handle this safely and efficiently, you should:
 
1. Use a **connection pool**  (e.g., HikariCP) to manage database connections.
 
2. Ensure proper **transaction management**  to maintain data consistency.
 
3. Implement **optimistic locking**  or **pessimistic locking**  based on the use case.
**Code Implementation (Using HikariCP Connection Pooling):** 

```Copy code
import com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariConfig;
import com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariDataSource;
import java.sql.*;
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class DatabaseAccessExample {

    private static final HikariDataSource dataSource = createDataSource();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);

        // Simulate concurrent database access
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            executorService.submit(() -> {
                try {
                    performDatabaseOperation();
                } catch (SQLException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            });
        }

        executorService.shutdown();
    }

    private static HikariDataSource createDataSource() {
        HikariConfig config = new HikariConfig();
        config.setJdbcUrl("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase");
        config.setUsername("root");
        config.setPassword("password");
        config.setMaximumPoolSize(10); // Max number of connections in the pool
        return new HikariDataSource(config);
    }

    private static void performDatabaseOperation() throws SQLException {
        try (Connection connection = dataSource.getConnection()) {
            connection.setAutoCommit(false); // Enable transaction management

            // Simulate a database operation
            try (PreparedStatement ps = connection.prepareStatement("UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - ? WHERE id = ?")) {
                ps.setDouble(1, 100); // Deduct 100 units
                ps.setInt(2, 1); // From account 1
                ps.executeUpdate();

                // Commit transaction
                connection.commit();
            } catch (SQLException e) {
                connection.rollback(); // Rollback in case of error
                throw e;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- **HikariCP**  is used as the connection pool to manage concurrent connections to the database efficiently.

- Each thread obtains a connection from the pool to perform a database operation (updating account balance).
 
- **Transaction management**  ensures that if an error occurs, the changes are rolled back to prevent data corruption.
 
- **Connection pooling**  avoids the overhead of creating and closing connections repeatedly.

**49. How would you prevent data corruption in a system where multiple threads are writing to the same file?** **Solution Explanation:** 
When multiple threads write to the same file, they must coordinate their access to avoid data corruption. This can be achieved by:
 
1. Using a **synchronized block**  to ensure only one thread writes to the file at a time.
 
2. Alternatively, use **Alternatively, use `FileLock`**  (from `java.nio.channels.FileChannel`) to lock the file while writing.
****46. Implement a multithreaded event-driven system using Java's `CompletableFuture`.** **Solution Explanation:** An event-driven system processes events asynchronously, often using a non-blocking, reactive model. In Java, `CompletableFuture` provides a powerful way to manage asynchronous computations and events. Multiple stages (events) can be chained together, executed concurrently, or handled based on completion.**Code Implementation:** 

```Copy code

public class EventDrivenSystem {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Simulate an event-driven system with CompletableFuture
        CompletableFuture<Void> eventSystem = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            // Stage 1: Simulate event generation

            System.out.println("Event generated: " + event);
            return event;
        }).thenApplyAsync(event -> {
            // Stage 2: Simulate event processing
            String processedEvent = processEvent(event);
            System.out.println("Event processed: " + processedEvent);
            return processedEvent;
        }).thenAcceptAsync(processedEvent -> {
            // Stage 3: Simulate event handling
            handleEvent(processedEvent);
        }).exceptionally(ex -> {
            // Handle any exceptions
            System.out.println("Error in event-driven system: " + ex.getMessage());
            return null;
        });

        // Wait for all tasks to finish
        eventSystem.join();
    }

    // Simulate event generation
    private static String generateEvent() {
        return "User_Login_Event";
    }

    // Simulate event processing
    private static String processEvent(String event) {
        return event + "_Processed";
    }

    // Simulate event handling
    private static void handleEvent(String processedEvent) {
        System.out.println("Handling processed event: " + processedEvent);
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- **Event generation, processing, and handling**  are each executed asynchronously using `CompletableFuture`.
 
- The method `thenApplyAsync()` is used for processing and chaining tasks asynchronously.
 
- In case of errors, the system handles exceptions using the `exceptionally()` method.
 
- `CompletableFuture` allows the chaining of events, which can be extended for complex event-driven systems like user actions, notifications, etc.

2. Implement a **matching engine**  that processes orders and matches them based on the market price.

3. Ensure thread-safe access to shared resources like the order book using locks if necessary.
**Code Implementation:** 

```Copy code
import java.util.concurrent.*;
import java.util.*;

public class TradingApplication {

    private static final ConcurrentMap<String, PriorityQueue<Order>> buyOrders = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
    private static final ConcurrentMap<String, PriorityQueue<Order>> sellOrders = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);

        // Simulate order submissions
        executorService.submit(() -> submitOrder("AAPL", 150, "BUY", 100));
        executorService.submit(() -> submitOrder("AAPL", 149, "SELL", 50));
        executorService.submit(() -> submitOrder("AAPL", 151, "BUY", 200));
        executorService.submit(() -> submitOrder("AAPL", 148, "SELL", 150));

        executorService.shutdown();
    }

    private static void submitOrder(String symbol, double price, String type, int quantity) {
        Order order = new Order(symbol, price, type, quantity);

        if ("BUY".equals(type)) {
            buyOrders.computeIfAbsent(symbol, k -> new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.reverseOrder())).offer(order);
        } else {
            sellOrders.computeIfAbsent(symbol, k -> new PriorityQueue<>()).offer(order);
        }

        matchOrders(symbol);
    }

    private static synchronized void matchOrders(String symbol) {
        PriorityQueue<Order> buys = buyOrders.get(symbol);
        PriorityQueue<Order> sells = sellOrders.get(symbol);

        while (buys != null && !buys.isEmpty() && sells != null && !sells.isEmpty()) {
            Order highestBuy = buys.peek();
            Order lowestSell = sells.peek();

            if (highestBuy.getPrice() >= lowestSell.getPrice()) {
                // Match orders
                System.out.println("Matched " + highestBuy.getQuantity() + " shares of " + symbol
                        + " at price " + lowestSell.getPrice());
                buys.poll();
                sells.poll();
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    // Order class
    static class Order implements Comparable<Order> {
        private String symbol;
        private double price;
        private String type;
        private int quantity;

        public Order(String symbol, double price, String type, int quantity) {
            this.symbol = symbol;
            this.price = price;
            this.type = type;
            this.quantity = quantity;
        }

        public double getPrice() {
            return price;
        }

        public int getQuantity() {
            return quantity;
        }

        @Override
        public int compareTo(Order other) {
            return Double.compare(this.price, other.price);
        }
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- **Concurrent data structures**  (`ConcurrentHashMap`) store buy and sell orders separately.
 
- **PriorityQueue**  sorts orders based on price to ensure the highest buy and lowest sell prices are matched first.

- The order matching logic runs in a multithreaded environment, ensuring concurrent order submissions are processed correctly.
 
- **Synchronization**  ensures that matching of orders happens atomically to avoid race conditions.

**48. How would you handle concurrent access to a database in a multithreaded application?** **Solution Explanation:** 
In a multithreaded environment, multiple threads may access the database concurrently. To handle this safely and efficiently, you should:
 
1. Use a **connection pool**  (e.g., HikariCP) to manage database connections.
 
2. Ensure proper **transaction management**  to maintain data consistency.
 
3. Implement **optimistic locking**  or **pessimistic locking**  based on the use case.
**Code Implementation (Using HikariCP Connection Pooling):** 

```Copy code
import com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariConfig;
import com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariDataSource;
import java.sql.*;
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class DatabaseAccessExample {

    private static final HikariDataSource dataSource = createDataSource();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);

        // Simulate concurrent database access
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            executorService.submit(() -> {
                try {
                    performDatabaseOperation();
                } catch (SQLException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            });
        }

        executorService.shutdown();
    }

    private static HikariDataSource createDataSource() {
        HikariConfig config = new HikariConfig();
        config.setJdbcUrl("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase");
        config.setUsername("root");
        config.setPassword("password");
        config.setMaximumPoolSize(10); // Max number of connections in the pool
        return new HikariDataSource(config);
    }

    private static void performDatabaseOperation() throws SQLException {
        try (Connection connection = dataSource.getConnection()) {
            connection.setAutoCommit(false); // Enable transaction management

            // Simulate a database operation
            try (PreparedStatement ps = connection.prepareStatement("UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - ? WHERE id = ?")) {
                ps.setDouble(1, 100); // Deduct 100 units
                ps.setInt(2, 1); // From account 1
                ps.executeUpdate();

                // Commit transaction
                connection.commit();
            } catch (SQLException e) {
                connection.rollback(); // Rollback in case of error
                throw e;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- **HikariCP**  is used as the connection pool to manage concurrent connections to the database efficiently.

- Each thread obtains a connection from the pool to perform a database operation (updating account balance).
 
- **Transaction management**  ensures that if an error occurs, the changes are rolled back to prevent data corruption.
 
- **Connection pooling**  avoids the overhead of creating and closing connections repeatedly.

**49. How would you prevent data corruption in a system where multiple threads are writing to the same file?** **Solution Explanation:** 
When multiple threads write to the same file, they must coordinate their access to avoid data corruption. This can be achieved by:
 
1. Using a **synchronized block**  to ensure only one thread writes to the file at a time.
 
2. Alternatively, use **Alternatively, use `FileLock`**  (from `java.nio.channels.FileChannel`) to lock the file while writing.
Code Implementation (Using `FileLock`):** 

```Copy code
import java.io.*;
import java.nio.channels.*;
import java.nio.file.*;
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class FileWriteExample {

    private static final String FILE_PATH = "sharedfile.txt";
    private static final ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Simulate multiple threads writing to the same file
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            final int threadId = i;
            executorService.submit(() -> writeToFile(threadId));
        }

        executorService.shutdown();
    }

    private static void writeToFile(int threadId) {
        try (RandomAccessFile file = new RandomAccessFile(FILE_PATH, "rw");
             FileChannel fileChannel = file.getChannel()) {

            // Lock the file before writing
            try (FileLock lock = fileChannel.lock()) {
                String content = "Thread " + threadId + " writing to the file\n";
                fileChannel.position(fileChannel.size()); // Move to end of file
                fileChannel.write(ByteBuffer.wrap(content.getBytes()));
                System.out.println("Thread " + threadId + " wrote to the file.");
            }

        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- **FileLock**  ensures that only one thread can write to the file at any given time, preventing data corruption.
 
- The file's write pointer is moved to the end using `fileChannel.position()` to append data.

- This approach is suitable for scenarios where multiple threads write to shared resources (like log files).

**Basic Multithreading Questions** 1. Create a simple thread in Java using the `Thread` class.** **Solution:** 
You can create a thread by extending the `Thread` class and overriding its `run()` method. Here's a simple example:

```Copy code
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            System.out.println(i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(500); // Sleep for 500 milliseconds
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.start(); // Start the thread, which will call the run() method
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- The `run()` method contains the logic of the thread. When the thread starts, it prints numbers from 1 to 10 with a delay of 500ms.
 
- `Thread.sleep(500)` pauses the execution for 500 milliseconds.

**Basic Multithreading Questions** 1. Create a simple thread in Java using the `Thread` class.** **Solution:** 
You can create a thread by extending the `Thread` class and overriding its `run()` method. Here's a simple example:

```Copy code
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            System.out.println(i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(500); // Sleep for 500 milliseconds
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.start(); // Start the thread, which will call the run() method
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- The `run()` method contains the logic of the thread. When the thread starts, it prints numbers from 1 to 10 with a delay of 500ms.
 
- `Thread.sleep(500)` pauses the execution for 500 milliseconds.


---

2. Implement multithreading using `Runnable` interface.** **Solution:** 
Here, we create a thread by implementing the `Runnable` interface.

```Copy code
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Hello from thread " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        thread1.start(); // Start the thread

        Thread thread2 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        thread2.start(); // Start another thread
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- `Runnable` is preferred when you want to share the same `Runnable` instance among multiple threads.
 
- The `Thread` class takes a `Runnable` object as its argument, which means the `run()` method inside `Runnable` will be executed in a separate thread.


---

**3. Implement a thread-safe counter using synchronization.** **Solution:** 
We can make a thread-safe counter using the `synchronized` keyword to ensure only one thread can increment the counter at a time.

```Copy code
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    // Synchronized method to increment count
    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Counter counter = new Counter();
        
        // Create multiple threads to increment the counter
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        t1.join(); // Wait for thread t1 to finish
        t2.join(); // Wait for thread t2 to finish

        System.out.println("Final count: " + counter.getCount());
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- The `synchronized` keyword ensures that only one thread can access the `increment()` method at a time, making the increment operation thread-safe.

- After both threads finish execution, we print the final count.

            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.start(); // Start the thread, which will call the run() method
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- The `run()` method contains the logic of the thread. When the thread starts, it prints numbers from 1 to 10 with a delay of 500ms.
 
- `Thread.sleep(500)` pauses the execution for 500 milliseconds.

        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.start(); // Start the thread, which will call the run() method
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- The `run()` method contains the logic of the thread. When the thread starts, it prints numbers from 1 to 10 with a delay of 500ms.
 
- `Thread.sleep(500)` pauses the execution for 500 milliseconds.


---

2. Implement multithreading using `Runnable` interface.** **Solution:** 
Here, we create a thread by implementing the `Runnable` interface.

```Copy code
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Hello from thread " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        thread1.start(); // Start the thread

        Thread thread2 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        thread2.start(); // Start another thread
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- `Runnable` is preferred when you want to share the same `Runnable` instance among multiple threads.
 
- The `Thread` class takes a `Runnable` object as its argument, which means the `run()` method inside `Runnable` will be executed in a separate thread.


---

**3. Implement a thread-safe counter using synchronization.** **Solution:** 
We can make a thread-safe counter using the `synchronized` keyword to ensure only one thread can increment the counter at a time.

```Copy code
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    // Synchronized method to increment count
    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Counter counter = new Counter();
        
        // Create multiple threads to increment the counter
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        t1.join(); // Wait for thread t1 to finish
        t2.join(); // Wait for thread t2 to finish

        System.out.println("Final count: " + counter.getCount());
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- The `synchronized` keyword ensures that only one thread can access the `increment()` method at a time, making the increment operation thread-safe.

- After both threads finish execution, we print the final count.


---

4. Demonstrate thread communication using `wait()` and `notify()`.** **Solution:** 
This example simulates a producer-consumer problem using `wait()` and `notify()` for inter-thread communication.

```Copy code
class SharedResource {
    private int data;
    private boolean produced = false;

    public synchronized void produce(int value) throws InterruptedException {
        while (produced) {
            wait(); // Wait until the consumer consumes the item
        }
        this.data = value;
        System.out.println("Produced: " + value);
        produced = true;
        notify(); // Notify the consumer
    }

    public synchronized void consume() throws InterruptedException {
        while (!produced) {
            wait(); // Wait until the producer produces an item
        }
        System.out.println("Consumed: " + data);
        produced = false;
        notify(); // Notify the producer
    }
}

public class ProducerConsumer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SharedResource resource = new SharedResource();

        Thread producer = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
                try {
                    resource.produce(i);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        });

        Thread consumer = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
                try {
                    resource.consume();
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        });

        producer.start();
        consumer.start();
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- The producer produces a value and waits (`wait()`) until the consumer consumes it.

- The consumer waits until a value is produced and then consumes it.
 
- `notify()` wakes up the other thread waiting to perform its action.

            try {
                Thread.sleep(500); // Sleep for 500 milliseconds
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();

            }
        }
    }
}

    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        thread1.start(); // Start the thread

        Thread thread2 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        thread2.start(); // Start another thread
    }

        Counter counter = new Counter();
        
        // Create multiple threads to increment the counter
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        t1.join(); // Wait for thread t1 to finish
        t2.join(); // Wait for thread t2 to finish

        System.out.println("Final count: " + counter.getCount());
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- The `synchronized` keyword ensures that only one thread can access the `increment()` method at a time, making the increment operation thread-safe.

- After both threads finish execution, we print the final count.

You can create a thread by extending the `Thread` class and overriding its `run()` method. Here's a simple example:

```Copy code
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            System.out.println(i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(500); // Sleep for 500 milliseconds
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.start(); // Start the thread, which will call the run() method
    }
}
```

- The `run()` method contains the logic of the thread. When the thread starts, it prints numbers from 1 to 10 with a delay of 500ms.
 
- `Thread.sleep(500)` pauses the execution for 500 milliseconds.

Here, we create a thread by implementing the `Runnable` interface.

```Copy code
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Hello from thread " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        thread1.start(); // Start the thread

        Thread thread2 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        thread2.start(); // Start another thread
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- `Runnable` is preferred when you want to share the same `Runnable` instance among multiple threads.
 
- The `Thread` class takes a `Runnable` object as its argument, which means the `run()` method inside `Runnable` will be executed in a separate thread.

    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Counter counter = new Counter();
        
        // Create multiple threads to increment the counter
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        t1.join(); // Wait for thread t1 to finish
        t2.join(); // Wait for thread t2 to finish

        System.out.println("Final count: " + counter.getCount());
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- The `synchronized` keyword ensures that only one thread can access the `increment()` method at a time, making the increment operation thread-safe.

- After both threads finish execution, we print the final count.


---

4. Demonstrate thread communication using `wait()` and `notify()`.** **Solution:** 
This example simulates a producer-consumer problem using `wait()` and `notify()` for inter-thread communication.

```Copy code
class SharedResource {
    private int data;
    private boolean produced = false;

    public synchronized void produce(int value) throws InterruptedException {
        while (produced) {
            wait(); // Wait until the consumer consumes the item
        }
        this.data = value;
        System.out.println("Produced: " + value);
        produced = true;
        notify(); // Notify the consumer
    }

    public synchronized void consume() throws InterruptedException {
        while (!produced) {
            wait(); // Wait until the producer produces an item
        }
        System.out.println("Consumed: " + data);
        produced = false;
        notify(); // Notify the producer
    }
}

public class ProducerConsumer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SharedResource resource = new SharedResource();

        Thread producer = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
                try {
                    resource.produce(i);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        });

        Thread consumer = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
                try {
                    resource.consume();
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        });

        producer.start();
        consumer.start();
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- The producer produces a value and waits (`wait()`) until the consumer consumes it.

- The consumer waits until a value is produced and then consumes it.
 
- `notify()` wakes up the other thread waiting to perform its action.


---

5. Solve the producer-consumer problem using `BlockingQueue`.** **Solution:** 
We can solve the producer-consumer problem more easily using `BlockingQueue`, which handles the waiting and notifying internally.

```Copy code
import java.util.concurrent.ArrayBlockingQueue;
import java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue;

public class ProducerConsumer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BlockingQueue<Integer> queue = new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(5);

        // Producer thread
        Thread producer = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
                    queue.put(i);
                    System.out.println("Produced: " + i);
                }
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
        });

        // Consumer thread
        Thread consumer = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
                    int value = queue.take();
                    System.out.println("Consumed: " + value);
                }
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
        });

        producer.start();
        consumer.start();
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- `BlockingQueue` provides built-in thread synchronization.
 
- `put()` blocks if the queue is full, and `take()` blocks if the queue is empty, managing producer-consumer coordination without explicit `wait()` and `notify()` calls.


---

**6. Implement a thread-safe singleton design pattern.** **Solution:** 
We can implement a thread-safe singleton using **double-checked locking** .

```Copy code
class Singleton {
    private static volatile Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (Singleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new Singleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Singleton singleton = Singleton.getInstance();
        System.out.println("Singleton instance: " + singleton);
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- `volatile` ensures visibility of changes to the `instance` variable across threads.

- Double-checked locking minimizes the synchronization overhead by only synchronizing the first time the singleton is created.

You can create a thread by extending the `Thread` class and overriding its `run()` method. Here's a simple example:

```Copy code
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            System.out.println(i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(500); // Sleep for 500 milliseconds
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.start(); // Start the thread, which will call the run() method
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- The `run()` method contains the logic of the thread. When the thread starts, it prints numbers from 1 to 10 with a delay of 500ms.
 
- `Thread.sleep(500)` pauses the execution for 500 milliseconds.

            }
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.start(); // Start the thread, which will call the run() method
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- The `run()` method contains the logic of the thread. When the thread starts, it prints numbers from 1 to 10 with a delay of 500ms.
 
- `Thread.sleep(500)` pauses the execution for 500 milliseconds.


---

2. Implement multithreading using `Runnable` interface.** **Solution:** 
Here, we create a thread by implementing the `Runnable` interface.

```Copy code
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Hello from thread " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        thread1.start(); // Start the thread

        Thread thread2 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        thread2.start(); // Start another thread
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- `Runnable` is preferred when you want to share the same `Runnable` instance among multiple threads.
 
- The `Thread` class takes a `Runnable` object as its argument, which means the `run()` method inside `Runnable` will be executed in a separate thread.


---

**3. Implement a thread-safe counter using synchronization.** **Solution:** 
We can make a thread-safe counter using the `synchronized` keyword to ensure only one thread can increment the counter at a time.

```Copy code
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    // Synchronized method to increment count
    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Counter counter = new Counter();
        
        // Create multiple threads to increment the counter
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        t1.join(); // Wait for thread t1 to finish
        t2.join(); // Wait for thread t2 to finish

        System.out.println("Final count: " + counter.getCount());
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- The `synchronized` keyword ensures that only one thread can access the `increment()` method at a time, making the increment operation thread-safe.

- After both threads finish execution, we print the final count.

**Basic Multithreading Questions** 1. Create a simple thread in Java using the `Thread` class.** **Solution:** 
You can create a thread by extending the `Thread` class and overriding its `run()` method. Here's a simple example:

```Copy code
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            System.out.println(i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(500); // Sleep for 500 milliseconds
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.start(); // Start the thread, which will call the run() method
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- The `run()` method contains the logic of the thread. When the thread starts, it prints numbers from 1 to 10 with a delay of 500ms.
 
- `Thread.sleep(500)` pauses the execution for 500 milliseconds.

            System.out.println(i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(500); // Sleep for 500 milliseconds
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.start(); // Start the thread, which will call the run() method
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- The `run()` method contains the logic of the thread. When the thread starts, it prints numbers from 1 to 10 with a delay of 500ms.
 
- `Thread.sleep(500)` pauses the execution for 500 milliseconds.

Here, we create a thread by implementing the `Runnable` interface.

```Copy code
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {

    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        thread1.start(); // Start the thread

        Thread thread2 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        thread2.start(); // Start another thread
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- `Runnable` is preferred when you want to share the same `Runnable` instance among multiple threads.
 
- The `Thread` class takes a `Runnable` object as its argument, which means the `run()` method inside `Runnable` will be executed in a separate thread.

        return count;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Counter counter = new Counter();
        
        // Create multiple threads to increment the counter
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        t1.join(); // Wait for thread t1 to finish
        t2.join(); // Wait for thread t2 to finish

        System.out.println("Final count: " + counter.getCount());
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- The `synchronized` keyword ensures that only one thread can access the `increment()` method at a time, making the increment operation thread-safe.

- After both threads finish execution, we print the final count.

4. Demonstrate thread communication using `wait()` and `notify()`.** **Solution:** 
This example simulates a producer-consumer problem using `wait()` and `notify()` for inter-thread communication.

```Copy code
class SharedResource {
    private int data;
    private boolean produced = false;

    public synchronized void produce(int value) throws InterruptedException {
        while (produced) {
            wait(); // Wait until the consumer consumes the item
        }
        this.data = value;
        System.out.println("Produced: " + value);
        produced = true;
        notify(); // Notify the consumer
    }

    public synchronized void consume() throws InterruptedException {
        while (!produced) {
            wait(); // Wait until the producer produces an item
        }
        System.out.println("Consumed: " + data);
        produced = false;
        notify(); // Notify the producer
    }
}

public class ProducerConsumer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SharedResource resource = new SharedResource();

        Thread producer = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
                try {
                    resource.produce(i);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        });

        Thread consumer = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
                try {
                    resource.consume();
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        });

        producer.start();
        consumer.start();
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- The producer produces a value and waits (`wait()`) until the consumer consumes it.

- The consumer waits until a value is produced and then consumes it.
 
- `notify()` wakes up the other thread waiting to perform its action.

    public void run() {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            System.out.println(i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(500); // Sleep for 500 milliseconds
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.start(); // Start the thread, which will call the run() method
    }
}

Here, we create a thread by implementing the `Runnable` interface.

```Copy code
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Hello from thread " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        thread1.start(); // Start the thread

        Thread thread2 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        thread2.start(); // Start another thread
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- `Runnable` is preferred when you want to share the same `Runnable` instance among multiple threads.
 
- The `Thread` class takes a `Runnable` object as its argument, which means the `run()` method inside `Runnable` will be executed in a separate thread.

    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Counter counter = new Counter();
        
        // Create multiple threads to increment the counter
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {

                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        t1.join(); // Wait for thread t1 to finish
        t2.join(); // Wait for thread t2 to finish

        System.out.println("Final count: " + counter.getCount());
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- The `synchronized` keyword ensures that only one thread can access the `increment()` method at a time, making the increment operation thread-safe.

- After both threads finish execution, we print the final count.

        producer.start();
        consumer.start();
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- The producer produces a value and waits (`wait()`) until the consumer consumes it.

- The consumer waits until a value is produced and then consumes it.
 
- `notify()` wakes up the other thread waiting to perform its action.


---

5. Solve the producer-consumer problem using `BlockingQueue`.** **Solution:** 
We can solve the producer-consumer problem more easily using `BlockingQueue`, which handles the waiting and notifying internally.

```Copy code
import java.util.concurrent.ArrayBlockingQueue;
import java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue;

public class ProducerConsumer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BlockingQueue<Integer> queue = new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(5);

        // Producer thread
        Thread producer = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
                    queue.put(i);
                    System.out.println("Produced: " + i);
                }
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
        });

        // Consumer thread
        Thread consumer = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
                    int value = queue.take();
                    System.out.println("Consumed: " + value);
                }
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
        });

        producer.start();
        consumer.start();
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- `BlockingQueue` provides built-in thread synchronization.
 
- `put()` blocks if the queue is full, and `take()` blocks if the queue is empty, managing producer-consumer coordination without explicit `wait()` and `notify()` calls.

**6. Implement a thread-safe singleton design pattern.** **Solution:** 
We can implement a thread-safe singleton using **double-checked locking** .

```Copy code
class Singleton {
    private static volatile Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (Singleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new Singleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Singleton singleton = Singleton.getInstance();
        System.out.println("Singleton instance: " + singleton);
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- `volatile` ensures visibility of changes to the `instance` variable across threads.

- Double-checked locking minimizes the synchronization overhead by only synchronizing the first time the singleton is created.


---

7. Demonstrate the usage of `join()` method.** **Solution:** 
Here, we'll use the `join()` method to ensure the main thread waits for other threads to finish execution.

```Copy code
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " - " + i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(500);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        MyThread t2 = new MyThread();

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        t1.join(); // Main thread waits for t1 to finish
        t2.join(); // Main thread waits for t2 to finish

        System.out.println("Both threads finished.");
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- `join()` forces the main thread to wait until the thread `t1` and `t2` finish execution before proceeding.

**Intermediate Multithreading Questions** 8. Use `ReentrantLock` to control thread synchronization.** **Solution:** 
`ReentrantLock` is an alternative to `synchronized`, offering more flexibility (e.g., tryLock, fairness policy).

```Copy code
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

class Counter {
    private int count = 0;
    private ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();

    public void increment() {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            count++;
        } finally {
            lock.unlock(); // Ensure the lock is released
        }
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Counter counter = new Counter();

        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        t1.join();
        t2.join();

        System.out.println("Final count: " + counter.getCount());
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- `ReentrantLock` is manually locked and unlocked, offering more control than `synchronized`.
 
- It provides flexibility, such as trying to acquire the lock (`tryLock()`), locking with a timeout, and fairness settings.

        t1.join();
        t2.join();

        System.out.println("Final count: " + counter.getCount());

}
```
**Explanation:**  
- `ReentrantLock` is manually locked and unlocked, offering more control than `synchronized`.
 
- It provides flexibility, such as trying to acquire the lock (`tryLock()`), locking with a timeout, and fairness settings.

9. Use `ReadWriteLock` to allow multiple reads but exclusive writes.** **Solution:** 
A `ReadWriteLock` allows multiple threads to read simultaneously but only one thread to write at a time.

```Copy code
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock;

class ReadWriteCounter {
    private int count = 0;
    private ReentrantReadWriteLock rwLock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();

    // Method for reading count
    public int getCount() {
        rwLock.readLock().lock();
        try {
            return count;
        } finally {
            rwLock.readLock().unlock();
        }
    }

    // Method for incrementing count
    public void increment() {
        rwLock.writeLock().lock();
        try {
            count++;
        } finally {
            rwLock.writeLock().unlock();
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        ReadWriteCounter counter = new ReadWriteCounter();

        // Readers
        Thread reader1 = new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println("Reader 1 read count: " + counter.getCount());
        });
        Thread reader2 = new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println("Reader 2 read count: " + counter.getCount());
        });

        // Writer
        Thread writer = new Thread(() -> {
            counter.increment();
            System.out.println("Writer incremented count");
        });

        reader1.start();
        reader2.start();
        writer.start();

        reader1.join();
        reader2.join();
        writer.join();
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- `ReadWriteLock` allows multiple reads at once but ensures exclusive write access.

- It helps improve performance when read operations outnumber writes.

    // Method for reading count
    public int getCount() {
        rwLock.readLock().lock();
        try {
            return count;
        } finally {
            rwLock.readLock().unlock();
        }
    }

    // Method for incrementing count
    public void increment() {

        try {
            count++;
        } finally {

        });

        reader1.start();
        reader2.start();
        writer.start();

        reader1.join();
        reader2.join();
        writer.join();
    }
}
```

- `ReadWriteLock` allows multiple reads at once but ensures exclusive write access.

- It helps improve performance when read operations outnumber writes.

10. Implement thread-safe increment/decrement operations using `AtomicInteger`.** **Solution:** 
`AtomicInteger` provides atomic methods for incrementing and decrementing an integer without synchronization.

```Copy code
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

class AtomicCounter {
    private AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);

    public void increment() {
        count.incrementAndGet(); // Atomic increment
    }

    public void decrement() {
        count.decrementAndGet(); // Atomic decrement
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count.get(); // Get the current value
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        AtomicCounter counter = new AtomicCounter();

        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.decrement();
            }
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        t1.join();
        t2.join();

        System.out.println("Final count: " + counter.getCount());
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- `AtomicInteger` ensures atomic operations without explicit locks or synchronization, improving performance in high-concurrency environments.

**11. Demonstrate deadlock and provide a solution to avoid it.** **Solution:** 
We’ll first create a deadlock and then show how to avoid it.**Deadlock:** 

```Copy code
class Resource {
    public synchronized void method1(Resource r) {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is trying to call method2");
        r.method2(this); // Deadlock occurs here
    }

    public synchronized void method2(Resource r) {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is trying to call method1");
        r.method1(this); // Deadlock occurs here
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Resource r1 = new Resource();
        Resource r2 = new Resource();

        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> r1.method1(r2), "Thread 1");
        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> r2.method1(r1), "Thread 2");

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```
**Solution to avoid deadlock:** 

```Copy code
class Resource {
    public synchronized void method1() {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " called method1");
    }

    public synchronized void method2() {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " called method2");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Resource r1 = new Resource();
        Resource r2 = new Resource();

        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            synchronized (r1) {
                r1.method1();
                synchronized (r2) {
                    r2.method2();
                }
            }
        }, "Thread 1");

        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            synchronized (r1) {
                r1.method1();
                synchronized (r2) {
                    r2.method2();
                }
            }
        }, "Thread 2");

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- In the deadlock scenario, `t1` locks `r1` and waits for `r2`, while `t2` locks `r2` and waits for `r1`, causing a deadlock.
 
- To avoid deadlock, threads must acquire locks in the same order. In the solution, both threads lock `r1` first, preventing a circular wait.

            count++;
        } finally {
            lock.unlock(); // Ensure the lock is released
        }
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Counter counter = new Counter();

        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        t1.join();
        t2.join();

        System.out.println("Final count: " + counter.getCount());
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- `ReentrantLock` is manually locked and unlocked, offering more control than `synchronized`.
 
- It provides flexibility, such as trying to acquire the lock (`tryLock()`), locking with a timeout, and fairness settings.

9. Use `ReadWriteLock` to allow multiple reads but exclusive writes.** **Solution:** 
A `ReadWriteLock` allows multiple threads to read simultaneously but only one thread to write at a time.

```Copy code
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock;

class ReadWriteCounter {
    private int count = 0;
    private ReentrantReadWriteLock rwLock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();

    // Method for reading count
    public int getCount() {
        rwLock.readLock().lock();
        try {
            return count;
        } finally {
            rwLock.readLock().unlock();
        }
    }

    // Method for incrementing count
    public void increment() {
        rwLock.writeLock().lock();
        try {
            count++;
        } finally {
            rwLock.writeLock().unlock();
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        ReadWriteCounter counter = new ReadWriteCounter();

        // Readers
        Thread reader1 = new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println("Reader 1 read count: " + counter.getCount());
        });
        Thread reader2 = new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println("Reader 2 read count: " + counter.getCount());
        });

        // Writer
        Thread writer = new Thread(() -> {
            counter.increment();
            System.out.println("Writer incremented count");
        });

        reader1.start();
        reader2.start();
        writer.start();

        reader1.join();
        reader2.join();
        writer.join();
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- `ReadWriteLock` allows multiple reads at once but ensures exclusive write access.

- It helps improve performance when read operations outnumber writes.

10. Implement thread-safe increment/decrement operations using `AtomicInteger`.** **Solution:** 
`AtomicInteger` provides atomic methods for incrementing and decrementing an integer without synchronization.

```Copy code
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

class AtomicCounter {
    private AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);

    public void increment() {
        count.incrementAndGet(); // Atomic increment
    }

    public void decrement() {
        count.decrementAndGet(); // Atomic decrement
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count.get(); // Get the current value
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        AtomicCounter counter = new AtomicCounter();

        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.decrement();
            }
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        t1.join();
        t2.join();

        System.out.println("Final count: " + counter.getCount());
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- `AtomicInteger` ensures atomic operations without explicit locks or synchronization, improving performance in high-concurrency environments.

**11. Demonstrate deadlock and provide a solution to avoid it.** **Solution:** 
We’ll first create a deadlock and then show how to avoid it.**Deadlock:** 

```Copy code
class Resource {
    public synchronized void method1(Resource r) {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is trying to call method2");
        r.method2(this); // Deadlock occurs here
    }

    public synchronized void method2(Resource r) {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is trying to call method1");
        r.method1(this); // Deadlock occurs here
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Resource r1 = new Resource();
        Resource r2 = new Resource();

        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> r1.method1(r2), "Thread 1");
        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> r2.method1(r1), "Thread 2");

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```
**Solution to avoid deadlock:** 

```Copy code
class Resource {
    public synchronized void method1() {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " called method1");
    }

    public synchronized void method2() {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " called method2");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Resource r1 = new Resource();
        Resource r2 = new Resource();

        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            synchronized (r1) {
                r1.method1();
                synchronized (r2) {
                    r2.method2();
                }
            }
        }, "Thread 1");

        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            synchronized (r1) {
                r1.method1();
                synchronized (r2) {
                    r2.method2();
                }
            }
        }, "Thread 2");

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- In the deadlock scenario, `t1` locks `r1` and waits for `r2`, while `t2` locks `r2` and waits for `r1`, causing a deadlock.
 
- To avoid deadlock, threads must acquire locks in the same order. In the solution, both threads lock `r1` first, preventing a circular wait.

12. Simulate a thread pool using `ExecutorService`.** **Solution:** 
You can use `ExecutorService` to create a thread pool and manage task execution efficiently.

```Copy code
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

class Task implements Runnable {
    private int taskId;

    public Task(int taskId) {
        this.taskId = taskId;
    }

    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " is running by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulate some work
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3); // Create a thread pool with 3 threads

        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            executorService.execute(new Task(i)); // Submit tasks to the executor
        }

        executorService.shutdown(); // Shutdown the executor after submitting all tasks
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**  
- `ExecutorService` creates a thread pool where multiple tasks are executed concurrently by available threads.

- The thread pool reuses threads to avoid the overhead of thread creation and destruction.

**13. Implement the Dining Philosophers problem.** **Solution:** 
The Dining Philosophers problem is a classic synchronization problem where multiple philosophers are seated around a table with forks between them.

```Copy code
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

class Philosopher extends Thread {
    private int id;
    private Lock leftFork, rightFork;

    public Philosopher(int id, Lock leftFork, Lock rightFork) {
        this.id = id;
        this.leftFork = leftFork;
        this.rightFork = rightFork;
    }

    public void run() {
        try {
            while (true) {
                think();
                eat();
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    private void think() throws InterruptedException {
        System.out.println("Philosopher " + id + " is thinking.");
        Thread.sleep((int) (Math.random() * 1000));
    }

    private void eat() throws InterruptedException {
        leftFork.lock();
        rightFork.lock();

        System.out.println("Philosopher " + id + " is eating.");
        Thread.sleep((int) (Math.random() *
```
