### 1. Introduction to Kafka 
**Apache Kafka**  is a distributed streaming platform that allows you to publish and subscribe to streams of records, store streams of records in a fault-tolerant way, and process streams of records as they occur.
### 2. Kafka Architecture 

#### Brokers 

A Kafka broker is a server that stores data and serves clients. Each broker can handle hundreds of thousands of reads and writes per second. Kafka brokers are stateless, meaning the state is maintained using Zookeeper.

#### Topics and Partitions 
 
- **Topics** : A topic is a category or feed name to which records are stored and published.
 
- **Partitions** : Topics are split into partitions to allow for parallel processing.

#### Producers and Consumers 
 
- **Producers** : Producers publish data to the topics.
 
- **Consumers** : Consumers read data from the topics.

#### Zookeeper 

Zookeeper is used to manage and coordinate Kafka brokers.

### 3. Setting Up Kafka 

1. Download Kafka from the official Apache Kafka website.

2. Extract the downloaded file.
 
3. Start the Zookeeper server:

```bash
bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
```
 
4. Start the Kafka server:

```bash
bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
```

### 4. Writing a Basic Kafka Producer in Java 


```java
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.KafkaProducer;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerRecord;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerConfig;
import org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer;

import java.util.Properties;

public class SimpleProducer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Define the properties for the Kafka producer
        Properties properties = new Properties();
        properties.put(ProducerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092");
        properties.put(ProducerConfig.KEY_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringSerializer.class.getName());
        properties.put(ProducerConfig.VALUE_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringSerializer.class.getName());

        // Create a new Kafka producer
        KafkaProducer<String, String> producer = new KafkaProducer<>(properties);

        // Create a new producer record
        ProducerRecord<String, String> record = new ProducerRecord<>("my-topic", "key", "value");

        // Send the record to the topic
        producer.send(record);

        // Close the producer
        producer.close();
    }
}
```
 
- **Properties** : Configuration for the Kafka producer.
 
- **KafkaProducer** : Creates a producer that can send records to Kafka.

```java
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerRecord;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerConfig;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.KafkaConsumer;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerRecords;
import org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer;

import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.Properties;

public class SimpleConsumer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Define the properties for the Kafka consumer
        Properties properties = new Properties();
        properties.put(ConsumerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092");
        properties.put(ConsumerConfig.GROUP_ID_CONFIG, "my-group");
        properties.put(ConsumerConfig.KEY_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringDeserializer.class.getName());
        properties.put(ConsumerConfig.VALUE_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringDeserializer.class.getName());

        // Create a new Kafka consumer
        KafkaConsumer<String, String> consumer = new KafkaConsumer<>(properties);

        // Subscribe to the topic
        consumer.subscribe(Collections.singletonList("my-topic"));

        // Continuously poll for new records
        while (true) {
            ConsumerRecords<String, String> records = consumer.poll(100);
            for (ConsumerRecord<String, String> record : records) {
                System.out.printf("Key: %s, Value: %s%n", record.key(), record.value());
            }
        }
    }
}
```
 
- **Properties** : Configuration for the Kafka consumer.
 
- **KafkaConsumer** : Creates a consumer that can read records from Kafka.
 
- **subscribe** : Subscribes to the specified topic.
